Do you know the dosage you're currently taking?|Understood, it's helpful to have that detail. Are you taking any health supplements?|Got it, thank you.

Is there a family history of neurological or genetic conditions?|Thank you for clarifying. Do you have any siblings besides the brother you mentioned? If yes, could you provide their basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation?|Thank you for sharing that. It helps to have a picture of your family structure. Now, let's talk about your personal history. Where were you born?|It's great to have such strong roots in one place. Are you a Canadian citizen?|Thank you for confirming. Were there any complications during your birth?|That's good to hear. As a child, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age?|It's quite common to have a smaller circle of close friends. How about your experiences in elementary school? Did you face any difficulties?|It's good to hear you were able to catch up. Did you experience any traumatic events growing up?|I'm sorry to hear about those experiences, especially losing your dad at a young age and the car accident. It's understandable how such events could have a lasting impact.

Keeps me on my toes.|Been at it for a good 15 years now.|Nope, never needed it.|Right-handed.|Honestly, don't see them much. Just Dr. Phillips for the panic stuff. Not big on doctors, feel like they don't really get it, you know?|Yeah, opioid pain meds and shellfish. They're off the table for me.|Taking Clonazapam for the panic. Sorry, not great with spelling on that one.|Yeah, it's 0.5 mg. Take it as needed, not every day.|No, nothing like that. Just the occasional vitamin D in the winter months.|Don't smoke. I'll have a drink maybe once a week, nothing crazy. As for marijuana, sometimes on the weekends to unwind. And, well, shrooms but that's not a regular thing, more like once in a blue moon.|Got diagnosed with panic disorder a few years back. That's the main thing. Other than that, just the usual ups and downs.|Nope, been lucky on that front. No surgeries or hospital stays.|No, nothing like that. Been pretty careful.|No seizures either.|No rehab or counseling for substances. Never felt I needed it.|Not really, aside from the occasional visit to a GP for the flu or minor things. Mostly just Dr. Phillips for the panic stuff. Like I said, not big on seeing doctors. Always feels like they're just ticking boxes instead of listening, you know?|Yeah, my mom had something similar, lots of anxiety, but back then, people didn't talk about it much. She never got official treatment, just dealt with it on her own. My brother's been in and out of therapy for depression. Seems like it runs in the family, but we're not the type to sit around and chat about our feelings all day.|Not that I know of. No big genetic things or neurological issues. Just the usual aging stuff as far as I'm aware.|Yeah, got another brother and a sister. My sister's living out in Alberta, working as a teacher. She's 56. My other brother's closer, in Vancouver, doing something with tech, always changing companies. He's 61. We're not super close, but we catch up now and then.|Born right here in British Columbia. Been around Lake Keith most of my life.|Yes, born and raised. Canadian through and through.|Not that I've been told. Pretty standard from what I know.|Yeah, but I was a bit on the shy side, took me a bit longer to warm up to people. Had a few close friends rather than a big group. Walking and talking were on track, though.|Was pretty average in elementary. Didn't stand out much, just got through it. Had a bit of trouble with reading early on but caught up eventually.|Yeah, had a few rough spots. Lost my dad when I was pretty young, which hit us all hard. And there was a car accident in my teens. No physical injuries for me, but it shook me up pretty bad.|Marks were pretty good, mostly Bs. Really liked gym and anything to do with sports. Always felt more at home on the field or in the gym than in a classroom.|Went to college for sports management. Felt like a natural step, combining my love for sports with something practical. It was a good fit for me.|Before landing my current role, I worked for a local community center, managing their sports programs. Was there for about 10 years. Before that, did some coaching for kids' soccer teams right out of college. Always been involved in sports one way or another.|Yeah, was married once. Lost my husband a few years back. We were together for a good chunk of my life. Haven't really been in the dating scene since. It's been tough, but I'm managing.|Thanks. As for hobbies, still love anything active. Hiking, biking, and when I can, skiing in the winter. Keeps me grounded, you know? Also, got a bit of a green thumb, love working in my garden. It's my little escape.|On a rough day, I'll maybe light some candles, put on some music, and just try to chill. Sometimes I'll smoke a bit of weed to take the edge off. Helps me unwind and not get too caught up in my head.|Not really. Guess it's just that sometimes, despite everything, the panic just hits out of nowhere. It's like a wave, and it doesn't always make sense. The medication helps, but it's not a fix-all. Just want to find a way to feel more... steady, I guess.

Could you tell me about your current living situation? Are you single, married, or in a common-law relationship?|I understand, Tina. It's important to focus on your own well-being and personal growth. Speaking of which, do you have any children or dependents?|It sounds like you're making a significant impact in your work, providing care and support to children who need it. That's really admirable, Tina. Could you tell me more about your work? Are you currently working, and if so, could you share the name of your employer and how many years you've been working there?|It's truly commendable, Tina, dedicating so many years to helping children and their families through some of their most challenging times. Your work sounds both challenging and fulfilling. 

Now, regarding your health and support, are you currently receiving any form of disability assistance?|It sounds like you're showing a lot of strength and resilience, Tina. Managing on your own isn't easy, especially with the feelings and challenges you've described. It's important to have support, though, and I'm glad to hear you have some connection with a doctor, even if it feels like they don't always fully understand what you're going through.

Could you tell me about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or do you use both hands equally?|It's interesting how certain details can become so integral to our daily lives that we hardly give them a second thought. Thank you for sharing, Tina.

Could you tell me about any current doctors you see regularly for your health? This can include general practitioners, specialists, or any other medical professionals.|It's spelled ""Xanax,"" and it's quite common for managing anxiety and panic disorders. It sounds like you're navigating some challenging waters with your mental health, and it's good that you're seeking help and trying to find what works best for you. Could you share the dosage of Xanax you're currently taking and if you're on any other medications or health supplements?|Thank you for clarifying, Tina. It's important to have something that can help manage those intense moments. Regarding lifestyle habits, could you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, and alcohol use?|It sounds like you've been through quite a journey in finding what works for you and what doesn't, especially in terms of coping mechanisms. It's commendable that you recognize the impact these substances can have and are making choices to support your well-being.

Let's move on to your medical history. Could you share any health conditions or diagnoses you've received, including details such as when you were diagnosed?|Thank you for sharing that with me, Tina. It sounds like you've been navigating a very challenging path with bipolar I disorder and panic disorder. Managing these conditions requires a lot of strength and resilience, especially when dealing with such intense fluctuations in mood and sudden panic attacks.

Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that we should be aware of?|It's clear you've faced a lot of challenges, Tina, and it takes a lot of courage to seek help and undergo hospitalization when things become overwhelming. It's also good to hear that you've received the necessary medical attention for physical health issues like your appendix surgery.

Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions? If yes, could you share when and how these occurred?|It sounds like that was quite an experience, but I'm glad to hear there haven't been any significant head injuries since then. Participating in sports like soccer can certainly come with its risks, but it's also a great way to stay active and connected with others.

Moving on, have you ever had a history of seizures? If yes, can you tell me when it started?|It's good to hear that seizures haven't been a part of your health concerns. Managing bipolar and panic disorders indeed requires a lot of focus and care, and it's important to concentrate on those areas.

Have you ever participated in rehab or substance counseling, considering the challenges you've mentioned with alcohol in the past?|It's incredibly brave of you to recognize when you needed help and to take the steps necessary to seek that help, Tina. Participating in a program and learning strategies to cope without relying on alcohol is a significant achievement. It's clear you're committed to your well-being and making positive choices, even in the face of such complex challenges.

Could you tell me about other medical professionals you have seen? If yes, who, when, and why?|It sounds like you've built a comprehensive support system with professionals who can address different aspects of your health, both mental and physical. Juggling these appointments and maintaining your health is indeed a significant effort, but it's commendable that you're actively engaged in managing your well-being.

Let's shift a bit and talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with a history of psychiatric conditions? If yes, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It's insightful to consider the impact of family history on our own health, both physically and mentally. It sounds like mental health challenges have touched your family in significant ways. Understanding this history can be an important part of your own health journey, offering context and perhaps guiding treatment options. It's clear you've given this a lot of thought and are aware of the complexities involved.

Do you have any siblings? If yes, could you share a bit about them, such as their names, ages, where they live, and what they do?|It's good to hear you have a brother, and even if life has taken you in different directions, you still maintain contact. Everyone handles life's challenges in their own way, and having a sibling to connect with, even if it's just during holidays or occasional calls, can be a valuable part of your support network.

Let's talk a bit about your personal history now. Where were you born, and if it was outside Canada, what year did you arrive?|It's wonderful to hear about your strong connection to Canada and British Columbia. Staying within the province for school and work shows a deep-rooted connection to your home.

Were there any complications during your birth, and as you grew up, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age?|It sounds like you had a relatively typical childhood with the usual ups and downs of growing up, friendships, and school life. Being able to navigate those emotional complexities and still maintain a brave face is a skill that likely has been both a help and a challenge for you.

Could you share any difficulties you faced in elementary school, including academic or social challenges?|It sounds like you navigated a complex social landscape in elementary school, balancing your academic strengths with the challenges of forming and maintaining friendships. Your intensity and loyalty, though perhaps overwhelming for some, also indicate a deep capacity for connection and leadership. Understanding and managing mood swings from such a young age without a clear understanding of what you were experiencing must have been quite confusing and isolating at times.

Moving forward a bit, could you share any traumatic experiences you had growing up?|I'm truly sorry to hear about the car accident and the lasting impact it has had on you, Tina. Experiencing such a traumatic event, especially during your formative teenage years, can indeed trigger or amplify existing mental health challenges. It takes a lot of courage to face those fears and anxieties, and it's understandable that certain triggers can bring back those intense feelings. Working through such trauma is a significant and ongoing process, and it's important to acknowledge the strength it takes to manage and seek help for these feelings.

Could you tell me about your average mark and favorite topic or class in high school?|Your interest in Biology and how it connected you to a deeper understanding of life and its processes is truly inspiring. It's wonderful how a passionate teacher can ignite that spark of curiosity and even influence career paths. Your journey into nursing seems like a natural extension of that initial fascination with understanding and helping to heal.

Did you pursue further education after high school? If yes, where did you study, and what type of studies did you undertake?|Completing your nursing program, especially while managing the additional challenges of mood swings and panic attacks, is a significant accomplishment, Tina. It speaks to your resilience, dedication, and the deep care you have for helping others. Nursing is a challenging yet incredibly impactful profession, and your journey to becoming a nurse is both inspiring and admirable.

Could you share a bit about your previous work history before your current position at the children's hospital?|Your journey through different nursing roles illustrates a thoughtful search for where you could make the most meaningful impact. It's clear that you've found a deep sense of purpose and fulfillment in working with children at the hospital. The ability to connect with and support kids through their health challenges showcases not only your skills as a nurse but also your compassion and empathy.

Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?|It's understandable to prioritize your well-being and focus on maintaining balance, especially given the complexities of managing mood fluctuations. Relationships do add another layer of complexity, and it requires a lot of mutual understanding and support to navigate those dynamics. Your self-awareness and commitment to focusing on your health first are commendable. It's important to be in a place where you feel stable and ready before considering sharing that space with someone else. 

What are some of your hobbies, Tina? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?|Your hobbies reflect a beautiful balance between engaging with the world through stories, connecting with nature, nurturing growth, and creating in the kitchen. Each of these activities offers a unique way to find peace, joy, and a sense of accomplishment. It's wonderful that you have found such a diverse range of activities that help you relax and reset. 

What do you do to relax on a particularly stressful day?|Your approach to managing stress through self-care rituals is both thoughtful and therapeutic. Disconnecting, indulging in a soothing bath, enjoying calming teas, engaging with nature, and expressing yourself through journaling are all powerful ways to nurture your well-being and find a sense of calm amidst the storm. It's clear you've developed a deep understanding of what helps you cope and find peace, even if just momentarily. These practices are invaluable tools in your journey towards maintaining balance and managing the complexities of your emotions and experiences.

Is there anything else you think the doctor needs to know or any additional comments you'd like to make before we conclude our interview?|Thank you, Tina, for opening up and sharing so honestly about your experiences and efforts. Your determination and resilience in facing these challenges head-on are truly admirable. It's important to recognize the hard work you're putting into managing your health and to acknowledge that it's okay to have tough days. Giving yourself grace and understanding is a crucial part of the journey. Please know that your efforts, your struggles, and your successes are seen and valued. Your commitment to trying, even when things feel overwhelming, is a testament to your strength. Dr. Diaz will be well-informed and can consider all this information to provide you with the best possible care.

Though I gotta say, I'm not holding my breath on finding anything new that's gonna make a difference. Been down this road more times than I can count. But hey, let's give it a whirl. What do you need to know?|Oh, right, the formalities. I'm Tina Amy Quinn. But really, just call me Tina. That's what everyone does. Feels less like I'm in trouble that way, you know?|Sure thing, it's December 3, 1983. Makes me a Sagittarius, if you're into that sort of thing. Not that I've found the stars to be particularly helpful in predicting the rollercoaster that's my life, but hey, it's a fun fact, right?|Oh, I'm female. And I live in New Samuel, British Columbia. It's pretty here, lots of nature and stuff. Good for the soul, they say. Not that it's been a magic cure for me or anything, but it's nice, you know?|Oh, I'm single. Been that way for a while now. It's just...complicated, you know? With everything going on in my head, it's hard to let someone else in. Plus, I've got my hands full with work and managing my own stuff. Relationships just seem like a mountain too high to climb right now.|Nope, no kids. Just me. Sometimes I think about it, you know, what it would be like to have a little one running around. But then I remember my own struggles and think maybe it's for the best. I'm a nurse for kids, though, so I guess I get a bit of that maternal fix at work. It's rewarding but also a lot, emotionally, especially with everything else going on in my head.|Oh, thanks. Yeah, I work at the local children's hospital here in New Samuel. Been there for, oh, about 15 years now, I think? Time flies, doesn't it? It's hard, you know, seeing kids in pain, dealing with their families and all that stress. But it's also kinda beautiful, seeing how strong these little ones can be. It's a lot to take in, especially on my bad days. But I guess it gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning, even when everything else feels like it's falling apart.|Nah, no disability assistance here. I mean, there are days, so many days, when getting up feels like I'm climbing Everest in flip-flops, you know? But I keep going, keep working. Sometimes I wonder if it's stubbornness or just fear of what stopping would mean. But no, I haven't gone down the route of disability or anything. Just me, trying to manage on my own, with a bit of help from my doc... when I feel like they actually get what's going on with me, which feels rare.|Oh, I'm right-handed. Always have been. It's funny, the little things you ask about, makes me think about stuff I normally wouldn't. Like, who thinks about which hand they use? But yeah, right-handed, through and through.|Yeah, I see a psychiatrist, for all the, you know, ups and downs and the panic that comes out of nowhere. Feels like I've been on this merry-go-round forever, trying different things, talking it out. Sometimes it feels like it helps, other times, not so much. It's like, I know they're trying to help, but it's hard to not feel like just another case file on their desk, you know? And then there's the medication merry-go-round, which is its own kind of fun. Speaking of, I'm on Xanex. Wait, no, that's not how you spell it, is it? Anyway, it's supposed to help with the panic stuff.|Oh, right, Xanax, that's it. My bad. I'm on 0.5 mg, supposed to take it when I feel a panic attack coming on. It's like my little emergency brake, I guess. And no, no other meds or supplements. I've read about people taking all sorts of vitamins and stuff for mood, but I haven't gone down that road. Just the Xanax for when things get too much to handle.|Oh, lifestyle stuff, huh? Well, I don't smoke cigarettes, never could stand the smell. Marijuana, well, I've tried it a few times, thinking it might help calm the storm in my head, but it's not really my thing. As for alcohol, it's a bit of a slippery slope for me. I've had my moments, you know, where I thought a drink would smooth out the edges, but it doesn't really work like that, does it? Ended up just making things messier. So, I try to stay clear of it now, keep to the straight and narrow as much as I can. It's tough, though, especially on the bad days.|Oh, where to start? So, I've got this rollercoaster in my head, right? Been officially riding it since my early 20s. They slapped a label on it, called it bipolar I disorder. It's like, one minute I'm on top of the world, thinking I can do anything, be anything, and then the next, I'm in this pit where getting out of bed feels like it's impossible. And then, there's the panic disorder. That came into the picture a bit later, like it decided the party wasn't complete without it. Panic attacks just come out of nowhere, gripping me so hard I can't breathe, can't think. Been dealing with that label for, I dunno, 15 years or so? It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Just a lot of ups and downs, trying to manage, trying to keep my head above water.|Yeah, there have been a few times when things got really out of hand, and I ended up in the hospital. A couple of those were because I just... I couldn't handle it anymore, you know? The thoughts, the feelings, they just got too loud, too much. And then there was this one time, a surgery, nothing related to my head, though. I had my appendix taken out when I was a kid. Other than that, it's just been the mental health rollercoaster that's had me in and out of places, trying to get a grip on things.|Oh, head injuries. Yeah, there was this one time, believe it or not, I was actually pretty good at soccer back in high school. Loved it, actually. But then, during a game, I took a pretty bad fall, ended up smacking my head right on the ground. They said it was a concussion. Had me benched for a while, which was a bummer. That was ages ago, though. Haven't had anything like that since, thankfully. Just the usual bumps and bruises life throws at you, nothing that's landed me back in the hospital, at least not for my head.|No, no seizures or anything like that. It's mostly just been the mental health stuff, you know, the bipolar and panic disorders. Those have been enough to keep me and my doctors busy without throwing anything else into the mix. So yeah, thankfully, seizures haven't been part of my journey.|Yeah, I've had my dance with that too. After realizing alcohol was becoming more of a crutch than a casual thing, I checked myself into a program. It was a bit back, a few years ago. It helped, you know, talking to others who got what it was like, learning some strategies to deal with everything without reaching for a bottle. It wasn't easy, admitting I needed that help, but I'm glad I did it. It's been a process, trying to stay on the straight and narrow, especially with everything else going on in my head. But I'm trying, really trying to keep it all together.|Well, aside from the psychiatrist for the mood swings and panic attacks, I've seen a few others over the years. There was a therapist I started seeing after the whole alcohol realization thing. They helped me work through some of the underlying stuff, you know, past traumas, family history, all that jazz. It's been an on-and-off thing, depending on how I'm doing. And then there's my regular doc, just for the usual health checks, making sure the rest of me is keeping up with the chaos in my brain. They're the one who keeps an eye on my physical health, makes sure nothing's going too awry with the meds I'm on. That's about it, really. It feels like a lot, sometimes, juggling appointments and check-ins, but I guess it's all part of trying to stay afloat.|Oh, family history, that's a bit of a tangled web. Yeah, there's some of that running through the family. My mom, she had her own battles, you know? Depression, I think, though it was never really talked about much. She had a hard time of it, especially after my dad left. I don't know all the details, but I remember there were days she just couldn't get out of bed, and then she'd be okay for a while, up and doing things, almost like nothing was wrong. But she never went to a hospital or anything. Back then, it wasn't something people did, or if they did, they didn't talk about it. And my uncle, on my dad's side, he was in and out of places when I was really little. I think it was schizophrenia or something serious like that. So yeah, there's a history. Makes you wonder how much of this stuff is passed down, you know?|Oh, yeah, I've got a brother, Alex. He's a couple of years younger than me, so that puts him at, what, 38? He lives over in Alberta, got a job there in IT or something techy like that. We're not super close, you know, life just kind of took us in different directions, but we catch up when we can. Holidays, the odd phone call here and there. He's got his own life, seems to be doing okay from what I can tell. Doesn't seem like the family brain chaos got to him the same way, or maybe he's just better at hiding it. Hard to say. But yeah, that's Alex for you.|Oh, I was born right here in Canada, never really left the country, to be honest. Born and raised in British Columbia, and I've pretty much stayed put. I've moved around a bit within the province, you know, for school and then for work, but Canada's my home through and through. Never had the urge to live anywhere else, really. I guess I've always found what I needed here, or at least I've managed to make do with what's around.|Oh, birth, that's going way back. As far as I know, there weren't any big dramas when I came into the world. Pretty standard entry, I guess. Growing up, I was on track with all that walking and talking stuff. Made friends, lost some, you know, the usual kid drama. I was always a bit on the energetic side, had a lot of passion for things, which I guess could be a bit much for some people. But yeah, I had my group of friends, did the sleepover thing, birthday parties, all that. School was okay, did well, especially in the early years. Things got a bit more complicated as I got older, emotions running high and all, but I managed. Always been good at putting on a brave face, even when things were a mess on the inside.|Oh, elementary school, that feels like a lifetime ago. Academically, I was pretty solid, you know? I liked learning, reading, all that stuff. Teachers always said I had a lot of potential, which felt good, I guess. Socially, well, that was a bit of a mixed bag. I was always a bit... intense, maybe? Like, when I made friends, I was all in, super loyal, wanted to do everything together. But that could be a bit much for some kids. And then there were the mood swings, even back then, though I didn't really understand what was happening at the time. One day I'd be super excited, wanting to lead every project and play every game, and then there'd be days where I just wanted to be left alone, which confused people. It made things a bit tricky, friendship-wise. I had a few close friends, but there were definitely times when I felt pretty lonely, like I didn't quite fit in anywhere.|Yeah, growing up had its rough patches, for sure. One of the things that really sticks out, it's a bit tough to talk about, but there was this car accident when I was a teenager. I wasn't driving, just in the wrong place at the wrong time, you know? It was scary, really scary, and it left me with a lot of anxiety, especially around cars and driving. Took me a long time to be okay with getting behind the wheel myself, and even then, it's never been something I'm totally comfortable with. That whole ordeal, it sort of amplified things I was already dealing with, made the panic attacks start, I think. It's like it flipped a switch in my brain, and suddenly everything was just more, more intense, more frightening. Dealing with that, trying to act like everything was okay when I was really struggling, it was a lot. It's something I've had to work through for a long time, and it still gets to me, you know? Certain sounds, sights, they can take me right back, and it's like I'm there all over again.|In high school, my grades were pretty good, actually. I usually hovered around the A- range, give or take, depending on the subject and, well, where my head was at any given time. My favorite class, though, that's easy - it was Biology. Something about understanding how life works, all the intricate processes that go on inside us, it just fascinated me. Made me feel like maybe there were answers out there, you know? Like, if we could figure out how cells divide or what DNA does, maybe there was hope for figuring out the mess inside my head too. Plus, the teacher was great, really passionate about the subject, and that kind of enthusiasm is contagious. Made me think, for a while, that I might want to go into something related to biology or medicine. Guess that's part of why I ended up becoming a nurse.|Yeah, I did go on for further education. After high school, I went to a local college here in British Columbia. I got into their nursing program, which was pretty intense but really rewarding. It was a mix of classroom learning and practical, hands-on experience in hospitals and clinics. I've always been drawn to helping others, and nursing felt like the right fit for me. It was tough, balancing school with everything else going on in my life, especially with my mood swings and panic attacks. But I was determined to make it work. Graduating from that program and becoming a nurse, it felt like a real achievement, like I'd managed to channel all that intensity and passion into something that could actually make a difference in people's lives.|Before I landed the job at the children's hospital, I worked in a few different places, kind of getting a feel for where I fit best in the nursing world. My first gig was at a general hospital, in the adult medical wards. It was a good starting point, learned a lot about patient care, dealing with emergencies, all that. But, I don't know, it didn't quite click for me. The pace was either breakneck or snail's pace, no in-between, and the emotional connection just wasn't there like I thought it would be.

After that, I did a stint in a community clinic, which was a whole different vibe. More personal, got to know the regulars, worked with families, that kind of thing. It was closer to what I was looking for, but still not quite right. I guess I was searching for something that felt like it mattered on a deeper level, if that makes sense.

Then, the opportunity at the children's hospital came up, and it just felt right. Working with kids, there's this honesty, this resilience they have—it's inspiring. They're going through these tough times, health-wise, but they still laugh, play, dream. Being part of a team that helps them through that, helps them heal, it's exactly where I feel I'm supposed to be. It's hard, emotionally draining sometimes, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Feels like I found my calling, you know?|No, never been married. I've had a couple of long-term relationships, though. It's tough, you know? Finding someone who gets it, who understands that sometimes I'm riding high and can take on the world, and other times I can barely get out of bed. My last serious relationship was a few years back. We tried, really did, but in the end, my... let's call them mood fluctuations... just became too much for him to handle. He was supportive, up to a point, but there's only so much someone can take, I guess, especially when they've got their own stuff to deal with.

It's made me a bit wary, I suppose, of getting too close to someone again. I've got friends, sure, and they're great, but letting someone in, really in, that's a whole other level of trust and vulnerability. Right now, I'm focusing on me, trying to keep myself as balanced as possible, and that's a full-time job on its own. Maybe one day, when I feel more stable, more in control, I'll think about opening up to someone again. But for now, it's just me, and that's okay.|Oh, hobbies, yeah, I've got a few of those. Always been important to me, you know, having something to dive into, take my mind off things. I love reading, always have. Give me a good book, and I can disappear for hours. Fiction mostly, but I'm not picky. If it's got a good story, I'm in. Then there's hiking. Being out in nature, it's like a reset button for my brain. There's something about the fresh air, the quiet, just being away from everything that's so calming. British Columbia's got some amazing trails, so I try to get out there as much as I can.

I've also gotten into gardening lately. There's something really satisfying about growing your own food, even if it's just herbs on the windowsill. It's like, I can't control much, but I can control this little bit of earth, you know? Plus, it's nice to have something to care for, something that depends on you but doesn't demand much in return.

And when I'm feeling up to it, I like trying out new recipes, cooking. It's another one of those things where you get to create something, and there's a clear start and finish, which is kinda nice when everything else feels so up in the air. So yeah, those are my main go-tos when I've got some free time and need to unwind.|On a really tough day, when everything just feels too heavy, I've got a bit of a routine to help me unwind and try to reset. First thing I do is disconnect from everything digital. No phone, no computer, just me and whatever I'm feeling. Then, I'll run a bath, throw in some Epsom salts or a bath bomb if I've got one. There's something about soaking in warm water that just helps melt some of the tension away.

After that, I might make myself a cup of herbal tea, something calming like chamomile or peppermint, and curl up with a book or maybe some soothing music. I try to pick something instrumental, so I don't get too caught up in lyrics or emotions, just let the melody wash over me.

If the weather's nice, I'll go for a walk, even if it's just around the block. Getting some fresh air, changing the scenery can really help shift my perspective, make things feel a bit more manageable.

And sometimes, if I'm up for it, I'll journal. Just spill everything out on paper, all the thoughts and feelings I've been carrying around. It doesn't have to make sense, and I don't have to keep it. Sometimes I tear it up afterward, but it's the act of getting it out that helps.

These little rituals, they don't fix everything, but they give me a bit of breathing room, a chance to step back and not be so overwhelmed by it all.|I think we covered a lot of ground here. It's been kind of cathartic, actually, talking about all this stuff. But yeah, I guess the main thing for the doc to know is that I'm really trying here. I know it might not always seem like it, especially when I'm in a low spot or if the panic gets really bad, but I am. I'm doing my best to keep everything balanced, to stay on top of my meds, and to use the coping strategies I've learned over the years. It's just, sometimes it feels like I'm fighting against my own brain, you know? And that can get pretty exhausting.

But I'm not giving up. I've come too far for that. Just, some days are better than others, and I guess I'm still learning to be okay with that, to give myself some grace on the tougher days. So, yeah, that's where I'm at. Thanks for listening, for taking the time to understand. It means more than I can say.",0.187555358724535,272|156|231|209|287|372|490|474|221|583|355|565|754|503|526|290|568|761|828|560|430|723|886|1006|812|750|1336|1036|1232|1327|874,626.3548387096774

Could you please tell me your full name?|Thank you, Sergio. Do you have a preferred name or nickname you'd like us to use?|Got it, Sergio. Could you please tell me your date of birth?|I understand, time can indeed feel stretched in challenging periods. Sergio, what is your sex?|Thank you, Sergio. And what city or town are you currently living in?|Port Nicole sounds like a peaceful place. It's good to have a quiet environment. Could you tell me your current marital status? Are you single, married, or in a common-law relationship?|I'm sincerely sorry for your loss, Sergio. Losing a partner is an incredibly difficult experience. Do you have any children or dependents?|I see, thank you for sharing that with me. Are you currently working, Sergio?|Studying medical physics sounds fascinating and challenging. It's good to hear you have something that can help distract and engage your mind. Are you receiving any form of disability assistance?|It's relieving to hear that the assistance is helping with the financial stress, allowing you to focus on your studies and well-being. Could you tell me what type of disability assistance you're receiving and when you started receiving it?|Thank you for clarifying that, Sergio. It's good to know you have support for your mental health needs. Could you please tell me about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous?|Got it, right-handed. Now, could you please tell me about your current doctors? Are there any specific doctors you're seeing regularly for your conditions?|It's important to have a team you feel is supportive, even if it can feel a bit overwhelming with changes. Regarding the Paxil and Olanzapine, could you share the dosages you're currently on for both medications?|Thank you for providing the dosages, Sergio. It helps to have a clear picture of your medication regimen. Are you currently taking any health supplements?|Keeping things simple can definitely help manage everything. Could you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, and alcohol use?|It's understandable to seek out ways to quiet things down, though it's good you're aware of the potential downsides. Let's move on to your medical history. Can you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received, including details like when you were diagnosed?|It certainly sounds like you're managing a lot, and it's commendable how you're navigating through these challenges. Regarding your allergies to anticonvulsants and penicillin, it's important to have that noted for any future treatments. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that we should be aware of?|It sounds like you're putting in a lot of effort to maintain that balance, which is really important. Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions? If so, could you share when and how they occurred?|It's good to hear you've been able to avoid those kinds of physical injuries. What about seizures? Have you ever had a history of seizures? If yes, could you share when it started?|Thank you for clarifying that, Sergio. It helps to have a complete picture of your health. Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling? If yes, could you share where and when?|It sounds like you're aware of the balance and the impact it has. Keeping an open dialogue about these things is crucial. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health, outside of Dr. Scott and your therapist? If yes, could you share who, when, and why?|It sounds like you have a core team that's been consistent in supporting you, even with some changes in therapists. Staying stable with your medication is a positive step. Let's shift a bit and talk about your family history. Do you have a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It's insightful to hear about your perspective and experiences with mental health within your family, especially regarding your mom. It's true that these experiences can shape our own approach to seeking help and understanding our own health. Do you have any family history of neurological or genetic conditions we should be aware of?|I understand, and you're right, sometimes these discussions weren't as open in the past, leading to less shared information about health histories. It's important to work with what we know now. Regarding siblings, do you have any brothers or sisters? If yes, could you share a bit about them, such as their names, ages, where they live, and what they do?|Being an only child does indeed shape your experiences and the way you might seek connections and support. Friends can become like family in many ways, offering support and understanding. Let's move on to your personal history. Where were you born?|It's great to hear about your connection to your roots in British Columbia. Being born and raised in the same place gives a strong sense of identity. Were there any complications during your birth that you're aware of?|It's good to have had a straightforward start. In your early years, did you find that you walked, talked, and developed friendships like other kids your age?|It's valuable to have that insight into your early development, emphasizing quality connections even from a young age. How about your experiences in elementary school? Did you face any difficulties academically or socially?|It sounds like those years were challenging, navigating both academic and social hurdles while trying to find your place. Those experiences can certainly impact one's sense of belonging and self-worth. Moving forward a bit, did you have any traumatic experiences growing up that you feel comfortable sharing?|I'm truly sorry to hear about the pain and loss you've experienced, Sergio. The impact of such events can't be understated, and it's clear you've been through incredibly challenging times. The resilience you've developed and your ability to articulate these experiences show remarkable strength. Thank you for trusting me with this part of your story.

Shifting focus a bit, could you tell me about your average mark and favorite subject or class in high school?|It's inspiring to hear how you found your passion in physics, turning it into a source of stability and interest during high school. That kind of connection with a subject can be truly transformative. After high school, did you pursue further education? If yes, where and what type of studies?|Your journey into medical physics is truly admirable, Sergio. It's clear you have a deep connection to your studies, using it as both a passion and a way to help others potentially. Balancing such demanding studies with personal challenges is no small feat, and it speaks volumes about your dedication and resilience.

Could you share a bit about your previous work history, if any? Have you worked at any companies or in specific roles before focusing on your studies?|Tutoring in physics and math not only complements your academic pursuits but also showcases your ability to share knowledge and assist others in their learning journey. It's a valuable experience in its own right, contributing to both your personal and professional growth.

Regarding personal relationships, have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships aside from the partner you mentioned?|Your reflection on your relationship and the process of healing shows a lot of insight and strength, Sergio. It's understandable to focus on your own well-being and healing after such a significant loss. Finding your footing again is a personal journey, one that takes time and self-compassion.

Could you tell me about your hobbies or interests outside of your academic pursuits? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?|Your hobbies of astronomy and music sound like meaningful and grounding practices, Sergio. They offer both a sense of perspective and a way to navigate your emotions and thoughts. It's wonderful that you have found activities that help you feel connected and provide a sense of calm and escape when needed.

For the final question, how do you typically relax or de-stress on a particularly stressful day?|Your approaches to finding calm and managing stress through stargazing, music, and walks are deeply personal and resonate with a sense of mindfulness and connection to the world around you. These practices are valuable tools in navigating the complexities of life and maintaining well-being.

Thank you, Sergio, for sharing so openly with me today. Your insights and experiences are invaluable, and this information will help Dr. Scott understand your situation better and provide the most appropriate care. If there's anything else you feel the doctor needs to know or any other comments you'd like to add, please feel free to share.|Your willingness to share and your efforts to move forward, even on the challenging days, are truly commendable, Sergio. It's clear you possess a strong sense of self-awareness and resilience. Please know that Dr. Scott and the rest of your care team are here to support you in finding ways to manage and hopefully improve your well-being. Your hope and your efforts are the foundation of the journey toward healing.

I'm glad to hear that this conversation has been cathartic for you. It's important to have spaces where you can express yourself freely and feel understood. We're looking forward to seeing you at the appointment and working together to support you.

Thank you, and goodbye.",0.28647497337593186,336|81|60|94|69|185|138|77|195|239|203|155|212|154|140|277|321|212|180|192|269|359|334|354|248|218|157|223|308|462|293|469|409|423|404|634|691,264.18918918918916,37,"Hey there,

Yeah, I guess chatting for a bit can't hurt, right? Though I'm not sure what more there is to say that hasn't been said a million times before. Feels like I've been through the wringer with docs, no offense. It's like, how many times can you go over the same ground without finding anything new?

Life's been... well, it's been a rollercoaster, you know? Ever since my partner passed, it's like I'm stuck in this weird fog. Can't seem to shake it off. And then there's the whole thing with my head being all over the place. One minute I'm up, next I'm down. Makes focusing on my studies a real challenge. Physics is tough enough without your brain going on a vacation every other minute.

Been trying to stick to the meds, Paxil and Olanzapine, but it's like a band-aid on a bullet wound sometimes. Plus, the whole PTSD and BPD cocktail, it's a lot. Makes you feel broken in ways you can't even explain. And I've got this thing about doctors... I know they're trying to help, but it feels like they don't get it. Like they're just throwing pills at a problem they can't see.

Anyway, I'm rambling. What do you need to know?|Oh, right, sure. It's Sergio Aaron Dunn.|Nah, Sergio's fine. No nicknames or anything.|Yeah, it's April 12, 2002. Feels like a lifetime ago sometimes, you know?|I'm male.|I'm living in Port Nicole, British Columbia. It's nice, quiet mostly. Helps a bit, I guess, with everything going on.|I'm widowed. Lost my partner... it's been rough, you know?|No, no kids. It was just me and my partner. Now it's just me, I guess.|No, not working. I'm a student, studying physics. Medical physics, to be precise. It's interesting, helps to distract the mind, at least when I can focus on it.|Yeah, I am. It's been a bit of a lifesaver, honestly. Helps take the edge off the financial stress, so I can focus more on my studies and trying to get through the day-to-day.|It's for my mental health conditions, the PTSD and BPD. Started getting it... oh, it's been a while now, hard to pin down the exact start date. But it's been a few years, for sure. Helps with the meds and therapy sessions and all that.|I'm right-handed. Always have been, just the usual stuff, you know?|Well, there's Dr. Shannon Scott, obviously. Been seeing her for a bit now. She's alright, tries to understand, I guess. And then there's my therapist, but it feels like a revolving door of faces sometimes. The names blur. It's more about the meds with the other docs, making sure the cocktail doesn't turn toxic, you know? Paxil and Olanzapine, keeping things... balanced, or so they say.|Ah, yeah, sure. For Paxil, it's 20mg once daily. And for Olanzapine, it's 5mg at night. Keeps the edges a bit smoother, or at least that's the idea.|No, no supplements. Just sticking to the meds and trying to keep everything else as simple as possible, you know? Too many variables and it all gets a bit much to handle.|I don't mess with nicotine or marijuana, never really saw the appeal. But, uh, alcohol, it's been a bit of a crutch, I guess. Not like, all the time, but definitely more than just socially. It's more about trying to quiet things down in my head, you know? But I'm aware it's not the best coping mechanism.|Yeah, so, there's the PTSD and BPD, right? The PTSD has been around for a while, kind of a fallout from some really rough stuff in the past. And the BPD diagnosis came a bit after, kind of like a one-two punch. It's been a few years, hard to remember exactly when each diagnosis was officially stamped on my file. It's like, once you're in the system, you're just kind of swimming through it.

And allergies, gotta watch out for anticonvulsants and penicillin. Found that out the hard way, not fun. Makes you a bit wary of trying new meds, you know?

Other than that, it's just been this ongoing battle, trying to keep everything in check, making sure I don't spiral. It's a lot, feels like a full-time job sometimes.|No, no hospitalizations or surgeries. Been lucky, I guess, in that department. It's mostly been about managing things with meds and therapy, trying to avoid any major crises. It's a tightrope walk, you know? Always trying to balance, making sure I don't fall off into something worse.|No head injuries or concussions here. Been pretty careful, or maybe just lucky, not to have any physical injuries like that. Most of my battles are, well, in my head, not from it getting knocked around.|Nope, no seizures either. Like I mentioned, gotta steer clear of anticonvulsants because of allergies, but seizures haven't been a part of my medical history. It's been more about the mental health side of things for me.|No, I've never been in rehab or gotten substance counseling. Despite leaning on alcohol a bit more than I probably should, it's never gotten to that point. It's like, I know it's not the best way to handle things, but I've managed to keep it from taking over completely. It's a fine line, I guess.|No, not really. It's mostly been Dr. Scott and whichever therapist is in the rotation at the time. There's been a few, names and faces change, but the story stays the same, you know? And of course, the occasional check-in with a psychiatrist for the meds, making sure the doses are still right, but it's been pretty stable on that front. No specialists or anything like that. Just trying to keep on, keeping on, with what I've got.|Yeah, there's a bit of a history there. My mom, she's had her own battles with depression, been on and off treatments for as long as I can remember. It's one of those things, you know, runs in the family, I guess. She's seen her share of docs over the years, been in and out of therapy, on meds. Kind of set the stage for me, in a way, made it a bit less daunting to seek help when I realized I wasn't doing great myself.

But it's tough, seeing someone you love go through that, and then facing it yourself. Makes you wonder about the whole nature vs. nurture debate. Anyway, that's the main bit of it. The rest of the family, it's hard to say. People didn't talk about this stuff much, you know?|Not that I'm aware of, no. It's mostly the mental health stuff that's been prominent in my family. No diagnosed neurological or genetic conditions that I know of. Like I said, mental health discussions were kind of there with my mom, but beyond that, our family didn't dive much into health histories or anything. Could be there's stuff that just wasn't talked about or diagnosed, you know how it is. But yeah, nothing confirmed or known on the neurological or genetic front from what I've been told.|No, no siblings. It's just been me. Sometimes I wonder if having a brother or sister would've made things different, you know? Someone to share the load with, or just to understand what it's like at home. But yeah, it's just been me navigating this stuff. Makes you rely on friends a bit more, I guess, for that sense of connection.|I was born right here in Canada, in British Columbia. Been a Canadian through and through, you know? It's a big part of who I am, even with all the ups and downs.|Not that I've been told, no. My birth was pretty standard, no major complications or anything. My mom's mentioned it a few times, mostly just stories about how long the labor was, but nothing out of the ordinary or concerning. So, yeah, nothing noteworthy on that front, just the usual birth story, I guess.|Yeah, from what I've been told and a bit of what I remember, I was pretty much on track with all that stuff. Walked and talked at the usual milestones. Making friends was... okay, I guess. I've always been a bit on the quieter side, so I wasn't the kid with a ton of friends, but I had a few close ones. Always been more about quality than quantity for me, even when I was little. So, yeah, no major issues or delays with those early developmental milestones.|Elementary school was tough, not gonna lie. Academically, I struggled. It wasn't that I didn't get it; it was more like I couldn't find a reason to care, you know? Everything felt... off, like I was just going through the motions without really being there. And socially, well, it wasn't great. I was the quiet kid, easy to overlook, and when I did get noticed, it wasn't always for the right reasons. Made it hard to connect with others or feel like I belonged anywhere. It's like I was on the outside looking in, trying to figure out how to fit into a puzzle where the pieces kept changing.|Yeah, there's been stuff. It's not easy to talk about, you know? Some things you try to keep locked up tight. But I guess it's no secret I've got PTSD for a reason. There was an incident, a car crash. I wasn't in it, but... my partner was. It's the kind of thing that splits your life into a before and after. One minute you're planning the future, and the next, you're standing at a funeral wondering how the world keeps spinning when your's has just stopped.

And growing up, well, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Family stuff, you know? The kind of environment where you learn to walk on eggshells, always bracing for the next storm. It teaches you to be on guard, always. Makes it hard to let people in, even when you want to.

So, yeah, there's been trauma. It shapes you, in ways you don't always want to be shaped. But you also learn resilience, or at least that's what they tell me.|Thanks for saying that. It's not always easy to see the so-called resilience when you're in the thick of it, you know?

High school was a different story for me, academically speaking. I kind of hit my stride, I guess. My average mark was pretty high, definitely a stark contrast to my earlier years. And my favorite subject... that's got to be physics. Something about it just clicked with me. It's like, for the first time, I found something that made sense, something that grounded me in the midst of everything else that was going on. It was more than just a class; it was like a lifeline, showing me there was a place where I fit, where my mind could latch onto something solid and real.|Yeah, I did. I'm actually still in the middle of it. I'm studying medical physics at university. It's been an extension of that passion I found in high school, diving deeper into the complexities of how physics can be applied to medicine, to healing. It's fascinating stuff, really. It feels like I'm on the right path, even when things get tough. There's something about understanding the underlying principles of the universe that helps put other things into perspective, you know? It's not always easy, balancing studies with everything else going on in my life, but it feels like where I'm supposed to be.|I haven't really had much in the way of a traditional work history, to be honest. My focus has been pretty squarely on my studies, especially given the complexities of balancing school with my mental health. There were a couple of part-time gigs, nothing major, just the usual student jobs to help make ends meet. Stuff like tutoring in physics and math, which was nice because it was in my wheelhouse and helped reinforce my own understanding while helping others. But no long-term positions at companies or anything like that. My path's been more academic, leaning into my studies and trying to keep myself on an even keel, you know?|No, there hasn't been anyone else, not like that. My partner was my first real, deep connection, you know? We were young, but it felt like we had something special, something that doesn't come around often. Since losing them, I haven't really been in the space to consider anything else. It's been about trying to find my footing again, figuring out how to navigate the world on my own. Relationships, especially ones that deep, require a lot from you, and I've been... well, I've been working on just keeping myself together. So, no, no other marriages or long-term relationships. Just memories and the process of healing, or at least trying to.|Yeah, sure. I've always been kind of drawn to the stars, you know? Astronomy, not just as a field of study but as a hobby. There's something about looking up at the night sky, realizing how vast everything is, and how small our problems are in comparison. It's calming, in a way. I've got this old telescope, nothing fancy, but it does the job. Spending time stargazing, it's one of the few things that can really take my mind off everything else.

And then there's music. I'm not any good at playing, but listening to music, getting lost in an album, it's another escape. Helps me process things, or sometimes just helps me not to think at all. Different genres, depending on the mood. Sometimes you need something a bit heavier to drown out the noise in your head, other times something light and airy.

Between those and my studies, my time's pretty much accounted for. They're simple things, but they're mine, you know? They help keep me grounded, give me something to hold onto when things get rough.|On a really tough day, I guess it's about finding those small moments of peace, you know? Like, if the weather's clear, I might spend some time with my telescope, just me and the stars. It's a reminder of the bigger picture, helps put things in perspective. Or I'll lose myself in music, let it wash over me and carry some of the stress away. There's something about music that can reach parts of you words can't touch.

And then, sometimes, it's as simple as just stepping outside, taking a walk. Fresh air, a change of scenery, can make a bit of a difference. Helps to clear my head, even if it's just for a little while. It's these little things, you know? They don't solve everything, but they give me a bit of a breather, a chance to gather myself before diving back in.

So, yeah, that's pretty much it. Stargazing, music, and walks. Simple, but they're my go-to methods for trying to find some calm in the chaos.|Thanks for listening, or, well, reading, I guess. It's not always easy to open up about this stuff, even if it's just typing it out. But it feels like it might be helpful, having someone else understand where I'm coming from before walking into another appointment. 

I guess if there's anything else for Dr. Scott to know, it's just that I'm trying, you know? Some days are better than others. Some days it feels like I'm backsliding, but I'm trying to keep moving forward, even when it feels like I'm walking against the wind. 

And, I don't know, maybe just that I hope this can be different. That maybe this time, something clicks, something actually helps in a more lasting way. I know there's no magic fix, but a bit of hope goes a long way.

Anyway, thanks again. It's been... cathartic, in a way, to lay it all out like this. See you at the appointment, I guess.",0.215072981829014,1135|40|45|73|9|117|58|70|160|175|235|67|388|148|170|305|717|284|202|220|297|431|697|500|332|162|307|459|592|888|692|609|635|646|1005|919|870,396.18918918918916

You do not need to correct yourself.",0.5,0.5,,76,38.0,38,"I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to participate in this process. Let's begin with some general information. Could you please tell me your full name?|Thank you, Jose. Do you have a preferred name you'd like us to use during our interactions and in your records?|Got it, Jose. Could you please provide your date of birth?|I hear you, Jose. It can indeed feel overwhelming at times. Now, could you tell me your sex?|Thank you for sharing, Jose. What is your current city or town of residence?|It's good to have a place that feels somewhat grounding. Could you tell me if you are single, married, or in a common-law relationship?|I understand, maintaining personal well-being takes precedence. Do you have any children or dependents?|Thank you for sharing that, Jose. It's important to recognize what you can handle. Are you currently working? If yes, could you tell me the name of the company and how many years you've been working there?|That sounds like a good fit for maintaining flexibility while having some structure. Since it's freelance, we can skip the company name. How about disability assistance? Are you currently receiving any form of disability assistance? If yes, could you specify the type and when it started?|It's important to have support that helps you manage, and there's no shame in utilizing resources designed for that purpose. Could you tell me about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or do you use both hands equally?|Noted, Jose. Being right-handed is quite common. Now, could you tell me about any current doctors you are seeing for your health?|I understand that finding the right healthcare professional who you feel truly understands you can be challenging. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies?|Definitely, it's good to have one less thing to manage. Could you tell me about any current medications and their dosages that you are taking?|Fluoxetine, understood. It's quite common for managing mood. Are you taking any health supplements?|It's understandable to have those thoughts, especially when navigating through treatment options. Let's move on to lifestyle habits. Could you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, and alcohol use?|I appreciate your honesty, Jose. Finding a balance can indeed be challenging. Let's pivot to your medical history. Could you share any health conditions or diagnoses you have received, including details such as when you were diagnosed?|It sounds like you've been navigating through quite a bit, Jose. Your resilience in facing these challenges is notable. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?|I'm sorry to hear you've had to go through all of that, Jose. It's important to have support during such times. Regarding your history of head injuries or concussions, have you experienced any? If yes, could you share when and how it happened?|It's a relief to hear you haven't had to deal with head injuries or concussions on top of everything else. Have you ever had a history of seizures that you mentioned earlier? Could you share more about when they started and any details surrounding them?|It sounds incredibly challenging to navigate, especially with the unpredictability of seizures. I'm glad to hear it's been a bit since the last one. Have you ever undergone rehab or substance counseling for your nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use? If yes, could you share where and when?|It's understandable how challenging it can be to manage on your own, especially when substances become a coping mechanism. Your efforts to manage and reflect on your use are important steps. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health concerns? If yes, could you share who, when, and why?|It sounds like you've been through quite a journey trying to find the right support and treatment. It can be frustrating when it feels like you're not making progress despite your efforts. Let's shift to your family history. Could you share if there's a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It's insightful of you to recognize the impact of family history on personal health. It can indeed feel like a shadow, but understanding these patterns can also be a step toward seeking the right kind of help and support. Do you know if there's a family history of neurological or genetic conditions? If yes, who and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It's helpful to have that context, even if the focus has primarily been on mental health within your family. Understanding the broader health history can sometimes offer insights into personal health challenges. Do you have any siblings? If yes, could you share each sibling's basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation?|Being an only child does indeed shape your experiences and perspectives in unique ways, including how you navigate challenges. It's natural to wonder about these what-ifs. Let's move on to your personal history. Where were you born? If you were born outside of Canada, could you share the year of your arrival?|It's interesting how one can feel both connected to and detached from their place of birth. Being a lifelong resident of British Columbia must have its own set of unique experiences. Are you a Canadian citizen?|It's natural to have those late-night thoughts and wonder about different paths and places. Let's talk a bit about your early life. Were there any birth complications that you're aware of?|It's good to hear there were no complications at your birth. In your early years, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age?|It's nice to have those simple and carefree memories from childhood. Did you face any difficulties during your elementary school years?|It's understandable to look back fondly on simpler times. As you mentioned things got more complicated later, could you share any traumatic experiences you had growing up?|Thank you for sharing that with me, Jose. It takes courage to open up about these experiences, and it's important to acknowledge the impact they have on you. Let's shift to a lighter topic for a moment. What was your average mark and favorite topic or class in high school?|It's fascinating how certain subjects can resonate with us and even influence our paths later in life. Your connection to English and storytelling is a beautiful example of finding solace and inspiration in education. Did you pursue further education after high school? If yes, where and what type of studies?|It's inspiring to hear how you've carved out a path that feels right for you, using your strengths and passions to make a positive impact on others. Finding purpose and fulfillment in what we do is incredibly important. Could you share a bit about your previous work history? Have you worked at any companies before, and if so, which ones and for how many years?|It sounds like you've explored various roles before finding something that truly resonates with you. That journey of discovery is valuable, offering diverse experiences and insights. Let's talk about relationships for a moment. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?|It's understandable to feel cautious about entering relationships when dealing with personal challenges. Taking time for yourself and focusing on your path is important. Let's shift to a lighter topic. What are some of your hobbies?|Your hobbies sound like wonderful ways to find peace and express yourself, Jose. Reading, writing, hiking, and music can all be incredibly therapeutic and enriching experiences. It's great that you've found activities that help you stay grounded and process your thoughts. What do you do to relax on a stressful day?|It sounds like you have a solid set of strategies for managing stress and finding moments of calm. Using your hobbies and interests as a way to cope and center yourself is a healthy approach. Remembering that bad days pass is an important perspective to hold onto. 

Is there anything else you think the doctor should know about you or your situation that we haven't covered yet?|Jose, it absolutely counts for a lot. The fact that you're here, willing to give this another shot despite your past experiences and fears, speaks volumes about your strength and resilience. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the challenges you're facing and to have mixed feelings about getting better. Your honesty and self-awareness are crucial steps towards healing. Dr. Waters will appreciate knowing where you're at mentally and emotionally, and this insight will be invaluable in working together to find a path forward that feels right for you. Your openness to trying again, to seeking help, and to holding onto that bit of hope is a powerful foundation to build upon. Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. 

If there's nothing more you wish to add, I believe we have covered all the necessary ground for now. Your courage and willingness to seek help are commendable, and I wish you the best in your journey ahead with Dr. Waters. Remember, you're not alone in this, and taking it one step at a time is okay.

Don't really see how it helps, talking never did much for me before, but let’s give it a shot, right? Docs always seem to think they’ve got the magic answer, but it’s all been a bunch of circles for me so far. Anyway, shoot your questions or whatever you need to know.|Yeah, sure, it's Jose John Anderson. That's me, though I don't really see how my name's gonna change much. But there you go.|Nah, Jose’s fine. It’s what everyone calls me anyway. Makes things simpler, I guess.|Oh, yeah, it’s August 31, 2002. Feels weird thinking about it, like, I'm 21 but sometimes it feels like I've been around way longer with all the stuff that's gone down, you know?|I'm a dude, male. Not sure how that plays into everything, but there it is.|I'm living in Robertberg, British Columbia. Got a small place at 5476 Wesley Underpass, Apt. 460. It’s alright, keeps me somewhat grounded, I guess.|Single. Haven’t really had much luck or energy for that kind of thing, you know? Relationships seem like a lot when you’re just trying to keep your own head above water.|No, no kids. Just me. Can barely take care of myself most days, wouldn't be fair to have someone else depending on me.|Yeah, sort of. I'm a student TEFL teacher, teaching English to folks online. It’s not really a company thing, more freelance. Been doing it for a bit now, helps to have something flexible, you know? Gives me a bit of structure without being too overwhelming.|Yeah, I get some disability assistance. Started a while back, after things got real bad and I couldn't keep up with... well, life, I guess. It’s for my mental stuff and the seizures I’ve had. Not exactly proud of needing it, but it’s been a lifeline, keeps me afloat when I'm sinking.|Oh, I'm right-handed. Always have been. Not much of a story there, just your regular right-handed guy trying to scribble down notes and stuff.|Not really seeing anyone regularly. I mean, I've been to docs before, had my rounds with therapists and whatnot, but nothing stuck. Feels like they don’t really get it, or maybe I don’t get them. It’s like we’re speaking different languages. So, no, no one specific I'm seeing right now. Just kinda floating, trying to manage on my own.|Nope, no allergies that I know of. At least that’s one less thing to worry about, right? Life’s complicated enough without having to dodge peanuts or whatever.|Oh, yeah, I’m on this med for my mood, called Fluxetine or something. I'm terrible with names. The dosage... I think it’s like 20 mg? Yeah, that sounds about right. Not sure it’s doing much, but they tell me it’s supposed to help.|Nah, no supplements. Just the Fluxetine. Sometimes I think maybe I should, like maybe there’s some magic pill out there that could make all the difference. But then I remember how the actual meds are supposed to be that magic pill, and well, here we are.|Ah, well, that's a bit of a mixed bag. I've dabbled in a bit of everything, to be honest. Smoked a fair bit, both cigs and weed. Alcohol, too. It’s like, sometimes it feels like they help, you know? Give me a break from my own head. But then sometimes, it's just another thing that messes me up more. Hard to find a balance. Been trying to cut back, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster.|Yeah, sure. So, I’ve got bulimia. Been dealing with it for a few years now. It’s like this never-ending cycle, you know? Also, had my fair share of seizures, which freaked me out the first few times. Got diagnosed with the bulimia thing back when I was around 17, after dropping out of high school. The seizures started around then too, but they couldn’t pin down why exactly. Just another thing on the list, I guess. And then there’s the mental rollercoaster, which they slapped the label of depression on, hence the Fluxetine. It’s been a ride, man.|Yeah, had a couple of stints in the hospital. Once was after a particularly bad seizure, and they wanted to keep an eye on me, run some tests and stuff. Then there was the time things got really dark, and I ended up there because of my bulimia... and well, trying to hurt myself. No surgeries, though, just a lot of monitoring, talking, and trying different meds. Feels like I’ve spent half my life in and out of those places.|No, nothing like that. No head injuries or concussions. I guess I’ve been lucky in that sense. Most of my stuff is more... inside, I guess. Mental and emotional, not so much the physical injuries.|Yeah, the seizures started a few years back, around the same time all the other stuff was getting bad, like when I was 17. It was scary, man. One minute you're fine, next thing you know, you’re waking up on the floor with people freaking out around you. They did a bunch of tests, but they never really figured out why they were happening. Just one of those things, I guess. Had to be careful, watch for triggers, but it’s not like there’s a manual for this stuff. It’s been a bit since the last one, thankfully. Trying to keep it that way.|Nah, never went to rehab or anything formal like that for the smoking, weed, or drinking. Thought about it a few times, especially when things seemed really out of control. But I always kinda just tried to manage it on my own, you know? Sometimes I’d cut back, try to get a handle on it, but it’s tough. It’s like, those things become your crutches, and even when you know they’re bad for you, it’s hard to let go. So, no, no rehab or counseling specifically for substance stuff. Just me trying to figure it out, bit by bit.|Yeah, I’ve seen a few over the years. Different therapists and counselors, mainly for the bulimia and the whole mental health rollercoaster. And then there were the neurologists for the seizures. This was all scattered over the last few years, especially heavy around when I was 17 and just after. Each time, it was like trying to find something, anything, that would click and make a difference. But it always felt like we were speaking different languages, or like they were missing the point. It’s hard to keep track of all the names and places, feels like a blur sometimes. Just a lot of trying and not a lot of getting anywhere, you know?|Yeah, there’s some of that in the family. My mom’s side, especially. She’s had her own battles with depression, been on and off meds for as long as I can remember. And I think her sister, my aunt, had some serious anxiety stuff going on. They both saw therapists at different points, I think. My mom was in the hospital a couple of times when I was really young, but it’s not something we talk about much. It’s like this shadow that’s always been there, you know? Makes you wonder how much of this stuff is just passed down, waiting for you to pick up where they left off.|Not much that I know of on the neurological or genetic front. If there is, it’s not something that’s been talked about much in the family. Seems like the focus has always been more on the mental health side of things. No stories of seizures or anything like that in the family, as far as I’m aware. It’s like I hit some kind of weird genetic lottery with that one. So, no, nothing I can really point to there, just the mental health battles that seem to run in the family.|No, no siblings. It’s just been me. Sometimes wonder if having a brother or sister would’ve made things different, you know? Like, would I have someone to talk to who really gets it because they’re going through it too? Or would it just be another person to worry about? Guess it’s one of those things I’ll never know. Just me trying to navigate this stuff on my own.|I was born right here in Canada, so no dramatic arrival story or anything like that. Been in British Columbia all my life. It’s funny, sometimes it feels like you can be from a place, know it inside out, but still feel like you don’t quite fit, you know? But yeah, Canadian through and through, from the start.|Yeah, I'm a Canadian citizen. Born and raised, like I said. It’s got its good points, but sometimes I wonder what life would be like somewhere else. Not that I’m planning on going anywhere. Just, you know, late-night thoughts.|Not that I’ve ever been told about. As far as I know, it was all pretty standard, no big dramas. My mom never mentioned anything out of the ordinary, just the usual stories of how happy they were, all that stuff. So, yeah, nothing noteworthy on the birth complications front.|Yeah, pretty much. I was walking and talking at the usual times, I guess. Had a few friends, did the normal kid stuff, playing outside, getting into minor trouble, all that. Never felt like I was behind or anything in those early days. It was all pretty standard, nothing that stood out as weird or different. Life was simpler back then, you know?|Nah, elementary school was alright for the most part. I was a decent student, got along okay with the other kids. Had my share of good times, nothing too heavy. It was later that things started getting complicated, but back in those days, it was mostly just normal kid stuff. Wish it could’ve stayed that simple, to be honest.|Well, it’s kinda hard to dive into, you know? There’s been stuff. Like, the family’s always been a bit of a mess, under the surface. My mom’s depression, that was a big shadow over everything. Made things feel unstable a lot of the time. And then there was just... I dunno, a lot of pressure, I guess. Pressure to be okay, to do well, to not add to the problems. Ended up dropping out of high school because it all just got too much. And there’s been other stuff, darker moments, hard to talk about. Just a lot of things that pile up, make you feel like you’re trapped in a tunnel with no light, you know?|Ah, high school... Feels like a lifetime ago. My marks were alright, I guess, mostly Bs and some Cs. Nothing spectacular, but I was getting by. Favorite class? Probably English. I liked the stories, the way you could dive into different worlds, different lives. It was an escape, you know? Made me think maybe I could do something with words, hence the whole TEFL thing later on. It’s funny how those little bits stick with you, even when the rest feels like a blur.|Nah, after dropping out, I didn’t go back to the traditional education route. Just felt like it wasn’t for me, you know? But I didn’t give up on learning altogether. Ended up getting into the TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) stuff online. Took some courses, got certified. It’s not college or anything, but it felt right. Like I was building something for myself, in my own way. Teaching has been good for me, gives me a sense of purpose, and I get to use my love for English to help others. It’s one of the few things that feels like it fits.|Before I got into the whole TEFL thing, I didn’t really have much of a ""traditional"" work history. Did some odd jobs here and there, you know, the usual stuff young people do to make a bit of cash. Worked a bit in retail, a local grocery store, and did some delivery stuff for a while. Nothing that lasted too long or felt like it was going anywhere. Just bits and pieces to get by and figure stuff out. It was all before I found teaching English online, which, honestly, has been the first thing that’s felt like a real job to me. Something I actually care about and want to stick with. So, no big companies or long-term positions, just a lot of hopping around until I landed on something good.|No, nothing like that. Been single most of the time. Had a few short-term things, but nothing that ever really stuck or felt serious. It’s been tough, you know, with all the stuff going on with me. Makes it hard to let people in, or to even want to sometimes. Feels like a lot to ask of someone, to deal with all my baggage. So yeah, no marriages or long-term relationships. Just me, trying to figure out my own path without dragging anyone else into the mess.|Hobbies, huh? I guess I’ve got a few things that keep me grounded. Reading’s always been big for me, like I mentioned with English class. Losing myself in a book, it’s one of the best escapes. And I’ve gotten into writing a bit, too. Nothing major, just jotting down thoughts, stories, sometimes poetry if the mood strikes. It’s therapeutic, helps me process stuff.

I also like hiking, being out in nature. British Columbia’s got some amazing places to explore, and it’s nice to just be out there, away from everything else. Clears the head, you know? And then there’s music – listening, not playing. Wish I could play an instrument, but never really got around to learning. Music’s another escape, a way to feel things deeply or just tune out the world for a bit.

So yeah, reading, writing, hiking, and music. Keeps me somewhat sane, gives me something to do with all the thoughts running around in my head.|On a stressful day, I kinda lean into those hobbies more. I might pick up a book and read for hours, just to get lost in a different world. Or I’ll go for a long hike if the weather’s good, try to clear my head with some fresh air and nature. Writing’s good for those really rough days, too, when my head’s just full of stuff I can’t seem to shake. Putting it all down on paper, it’s like letting some of the pressure out, you know?

Music’s a big one as well. I’ll put on some headphones, blast my favorite tunes, and just zone out. Sometimes it’s the only thing that can really calm me down, make me feel a bit more centered.

And if all else fails, I just try to remind myself that it’s okay to have bad days, that they pass. Might watch some mindless TV or cook something, just to keep my hands busy. It’s all about finding those little things that help, even if it’s just for a moment.|I guess the main thing is just that I’ve been struggling a lot, more than I usually let on. It’s like, I try to keep all these plates spinning – the bulimia, dealing with my mood, trying to stay sober, managing the seizures – and it just feels like it’s only a matter of time before they all come crashing down. I’ve got this resistance to doctors because it feels like I’ve been through it all before, and nothing really changes. But deep down, I know I need help, I just don’t know how to make it stick, you know?

And there’s a part of me that’s scared of getting better because I don’t really know who I am without all this stuff. It’s been my identity for so long, the sick guy, the one who’s always struggling. But I’m tired, man. Really tired. I want to believe there’s a way out, that things can get better. I just don’t know how to get there.

So yeah, that’s where I’m at. Just a lot of confusion, fear, and a tiny bit of hope that maybe this time will be different. Maybe Dr. Waters can see something others haven’t, or maybe I’m just more ready to hear it now. Either way, I’m here, giving it another shot.

Every bit of information you provide is valuable, and it helps us tailor the care and support to your specific needs. Let's start with some basic information, if that's okay with you.

Could you please tell me your full name?|Thank you, Oscar. It's nice to meet you, even in this format. Do you have a preferred name or nickname that you like to go by?|Understood, Oscar. We'll stick with that. Could you please tell me your date of birth?|Got it, thank you. And what is your sex?|Thank you for clarifying. Could you tell me your current city or town of residence?|Thank you, Oscar. And your current marital status? Are you single, married, or in a common-law relationship?|I understand, relationships can indeed be complex. Do you have any children or dependents?|It sounds like you're doing your best in a challenging situation. Could you tell me your child's name and age?|I completely understand and respect your need for privacy, especially when it involves others. Let's move on to another topic then. Are you currently working? If yes, could you tell me the name of the company and how many years you've been working there?|It sounds like you have a wealth of experience in your field. Your perspective on the continuity of challenges despite changing faces is quite insightful. Are you receiving any form of disability assistance?|It's good to hear that you're receiving support that helps maintain some stability. Could you share what type of disability assistance you're receiving and when you started receiving it?|It sounds like navigating through those challenges has been a significant part of your journey, and it's important to have that support. Let's talk about something a bit simpler. What is your handedness: left, right, or both?|Absolutely, it's the small details that often paint the larger picture. Could you tell me about your current doctors?|It's important to have a healthcare professional like Dr. Hamilton to work with, someone who can help navigate through the complexities. Let's move on to something else. Do you have any allergies?|Noted, it's crucial to be aware of those allergies, especially penicillin, given its common use. And it's unfortunate about the pet dander, as pets can be such great companions. Can you tell me about any current medications and their dosages that you're on?|It's important to find that balance with medication where it supports you without dulling life's experiences too much. Do you happen to remember the specific dosage of Olanzapine you're currently taking?|Thank you for sharing that, Oscar. Finding the right dosage can indeed feel like aiming for a moving target, but it sounds like you're on a path to finding what works best for you. Are you taking any health supplements?|Understandable, keeping things simple can certainly make managing everything a bit easier. Let's touch on lifestyle habits. Could you share your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use?|Thank you for sharing that with me, Oscar. It's important to have an understanding of all aspects of our lives, including substance use, as it helps in providing comprehensive care. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Could you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received, and any details such as when you were diagnosed?|It sounds like you've been navigating a complex and challenging journey with your mental health, Oscar. Your resilience and openness in discussing these experiences are truly commendable. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that we should be aware of?|Absolutely, keeping the ship steady is a good goal. It's important to have those experiences documented so we can provide the most comprehensive care possible. Regarding the hospitalizations for mental health, can you recall any specific years or durations for those stays?

And for the surgeries, even though they were for ""wear and tear,"" could you specify what they were for and when they occurred? This information helps us get a complete picture of your health history.|Thank you for providing those details, Oscar. It's helpful to have an understanding of those significant events and how they've played into your overall health narrative. Let's shift our focus a bit. Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions? If yes, could you share when and how they occurred?|It's good to hear you were able to recover without severe complications from that fall. Even without an official diagnosis, it's important to note these incidents as part of your medical history. Have you ever had a history of seizures? If yes, could you tell me when it started?|That's good to hear, Oscar. It helps to narrow down the areas we need to focus on. Have you ever had any history of rehabilitation or substance counseling? If yes, could you share where and when?|It's commendable that you took steps to address and manage substance use, recognizing the importance of such programs in the journey toward better health and well-being. It's a continuous process, and every step forward counts. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health concerns? If yes, could you tell me who, when, and why?|Your journey reflects a strong commitment to seeking understanding and balance, navigating through various professional insights to find what best supports your well-being. It's a testament to your resilience. Now, let's move on to your family history. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It certainly does make one reflect on the complexities of genetics and environment in shaping our experiences. The awareness of these patterns in your family can be a valuable part of understanding your own journey. Is there a family history of neurological or genetic conditions that you're aware of? If yes, could you specify who and whether they received treatment or hospital care?|It's helpful to have a clear picture of both the mental and physical health landscapes within your family, as it can inform your own health journey. Let's touch on your siblings, if you have any. Could you provide some basic information about them, such as their names, ages, where they live, and what they do for a living?|I respect your privacy and the sensitivity around certain topics. Focusing on the present and your own experiences is absolutely fine. Let's shift to your personal history, then. Where were you born, and if it was outside Canada, what year did you arrive here?|British Columbia is indeed a beautiful place with a lot to offer, both in scenery and experiences. It's interesting how our surroundings contribute to our life's story. Are you a Canadian citizen?|It's great to have such a strong connection to your home country and its culture. Let's discuss a bit about your early life. Were there any birth complications that you're aware of?|It's good to hear there were no complications at the start. In your early years, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age, or were there any notable differences?|It sounds like those early years set a tone of introspection and perhaps feeling a bit different from others. It's not uncommon, and many people find their own path and pace in social development. How about your experiences in elementary school? Did you face any difficulties there?|Your reflections on elementary school highlight how challenging and isolating those years can be when one feels out of sync with peers and the educational system. It's a testament to your resilience that you navigated through that time. Moving forward, did you have any traumatic experiences growing up that you feel comfortable sharing?|I appreciate your openness and the trust you're showing by sharing even that much. It's clear you've faced significant challenges, and your strength in continuing forward is evident. Let's shift to a lighter topic. What was your average mark and favorite subject or class in high school?|Your curiosity and desire to understand the ""how"" and ""why"" behind things is a valuable trait, even if the traditional school setting wasn't the best fit for you. It's clear you have a mind geared towards inquiry and problem-solving. After leaving high school, did you pursue any further education or training, perhaps in a more hands-on or technical field?|It's inspiring to hear how you found your passion and a sense of fulfillment in the practical and tangible aspects of manufacturing systems. Learning on the job and through hands-on experience can offer a very real and immediate sense of achievement. It's clear you've carved out a niche for yourself where you can apply your inquisitive nature and problem-solving skills effectively. 

Could you share a bit about your previous work history before your current role? What companies did you work for, and how long did you work there?|Your journey through different roles and companies sounds like it was rich with learning and growth, both professionally and personally. It's great that each experience brought you closer to understanding your own goals and preferences. 

Shifting focus a bit, have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?|Life indeed has its own rhythm and sometimes, despite our best efforts, things go in unexpected directions. It's important to recognize the value in each experience, learning and growing from them. Being solo does offer its own set of freedoms and opportunities for self-discovery. 

Let's talk about something a bit lighter. What are your hobbies? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?|Your hobbies reflect a deep appreciation for both creativity and nature, from the hands-on problem-solving of tinkering to the reflective solitude of hiking and the artistic pursuit of photography. Each of these activities offers a unique way to engage with the world around you and provides a valuable balance to the complexities of daily life.

On a stressful day, what do you find helps you relax and unwind?|Finding solace in nature, immersing yourself in a project, and connecting with music are powerful ways to regain your balance and center yourself. It's clear you have a strong sense of what brings you peace and how to navigate back to a place of calm. Your strategies highlight the importance of engaging with both the external world and your inner self.

Before we conclude, is there anything else you feel the doctor needs to know or any additional comments you'd like to make?|Your resilience and openness to exploring new or different paths in search of well-being are truly admirable, Oscar. It's important to acknowledge both the caution that comes from past experiences and the willingness to remain engaged in the process of finding what works best for you. I'll ensure Dr. Hamilton understands your perspective and your commitment to continuing the journey toward better mental health, with an openness to trying new approaches as part of that process.

Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences and thoughts with me today. Your insights are invaluable and will greatly assist Dr. Hamilton in providing you with the most appropriate care. If there's nothing else you'd like to add, I wish you the best until your appointment.

I've been down this road before, you know? Chatting away, hoping something sticks, but it feels like spinning wheels in the mud most days. Not sure what new thing I can tell you or Dr. Hamilton that hasn't been heard a dozen times over by others. But sure, let's give it a whirl, maybe this time it'll be different, huh?|Oh, right, the formalities. Name's Oscar Webb. There you have it, my grand introduction.|Nah, Oscar's fine. Never was much for nicknames. They always seemed a bit too chummy for my taste, you know?|Sure thing. It's August 18, 1971. Been around the block a few times, if you catch my drift.|I'm a guy, male.|Yeah, I'm holed up in Tannerfurt, British Columbia. It's where I've got my digs, at 120 Jonathan Lodge.|Single. Been that way for a good stretch. Relationships... well, they're a bit of a minefield, aren't they?|Yeah, got a kid. It's a whole thing, you know? Trying to be there, but it's like walking a tightrope with everything else going on.|Ah, getting into the nitty-gritty, huh? Well, I suppose it's part of the whole spiel. But let's just say, keeping some cards close to my chest, alright? It's not that I don't trust the process, it's just... Well, it's complicated, and I'm not too keen on broadcasting every detail of my life, especially the bits that touch on others.|Yeah, I'm still grinding away. I'm a manufacturing systems engineer. Been in this line of work for a good chunk of time, but as for the company, let's just say it's one of those places that makes stuff that makes other stuff, you know? Been there long enough to see the faces change but the problems stay the same. It's a job, keeps the lights on and all that.|Yeah, that's part of the circus. Got some assistance coming my way. It's a bit of a dance, dealing with the paperwork and the hoops, but it helps, you know? Keeps things a bit more level, even when it feels like the ground's about to give.|Oh, you know, the usual rigmarole with these things. It's for my head, the way it gets all tangled up. Started a while back, after things got too thick to handle on my own and it was clear I wasn't just going to ""snap out of it,"" like some folks thought. Can't say I keep track of the dates and times; it's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. But it's there, and it's something, which is better than nothing, I suppose.|Right-handed. Always have been. It's the little things, right? Stick to what you know.|Ah, the merry-go-round of docs, eh? It's been a bit of a carousel, to be honest. I've seen a few over the years, names and faces in a bit of a fog. Right now, though, it's Dr. Hamilton who's got the ticket to the Oscar show, if you catch my drift. Can't say I've kept a roster of everyone who's taken a crack at the puzzle that's me, but here we are, giving it another go.|Oh yeah, got a couple of those. Penicillin turns me into a bit of a balloon, not a great look. And pet dander, which is a real kick in the teeth, 'cause who doesn't like a furry friend, right? But yeah, those are the big no-nos for me.|Yeah, there's this one pill I've been on, Olanzapine. It's supposed to keep the roller coaster in the brain from going off the rails too much. As for the dosage, let's just say it's enough to notice but not enough to make the world seem too dull. Got to keep some of the colors in life, you know?|Ah, specifics, right. Well, it's been a bit of a moving target, but last I checked, we settled on 10 mg. It's like aiming for a sweet spot, not too much to zombify me, but enough to keep the edges from fraying.|Nope, no supplements. Just the ol' Olanzapine and whatever's in my coffee these days. Sometimes think I should look into it, you know, vitamins or something, but haven't really gone down that road. Life's complicated enough without adding a chemistry set into the mix.|Ah, lifestyle habits, the spice of life, or so they say. Well, I've dabbled here and there, you know? A bit of this, a bit of that. Alcohol's been a companion, more often than it probably should. As for smoking, let's just say it's been a friend at times too. Marijuana? Yeah, it's made an appearance or two. Not much for keeping a tally on these things. It's all part of the tapestry, isn't it? But yeah, they've been in the mix, helping to paint the picture, for better or worse.|Oh, where to start with that saga? The docs have pinned a few labels on me over the years. Major depressive disorder, bipolar II disorder, and, oh, let's not forget the cherry on top, narcissistic personality disorder. Quite the cocktail, huh? As for when all this came to be, it's been a gradual parade of diagnoses. The depression bit has been a lifelong companion, really dug its claws in deep a while back. The bipolar II and the narcissism tags, those came later, after enough people got a good look under the hood, so to speak.

It's been a journey, you know? One of those ""not all who wander are lost"" deals, except sometimes it feels like I've got a faulty compass. Been on a slew of meds, Olanzapine being the current ticket, and danced through a few different therapy rooms. It's a process, or so they tell me.|Hospitalizations, yeah, there've been a couple of those. Not my favorite vacation spots, if you get my drift. A few times for the mental health rodeo, when the ride got too wild to handle on my own. As for surgeries, nothing too dramatic, just the usual wear and tear repairs on an aging chassis. Nothing directly related to the head stuff, more like side quests in the grand adventure of life. It's been a bit since the last hospital stay, trying to keep it that way, you know? Keep the ship steady and all that.|Ah, the specifics. Well, the mental health stints, they're a bit of a blur, but let's say there was a notable one around five years back. Spent a bit of time in the psych ward then, a couple of weeks, trying to get the meds and the mind to play nice together. There might have been another one or two before that, shorter, kind of like tune-ups, you know?

As for surgeries, nothing too exotic. Had a bit of a go-around with an appendectomy, oh, ages ago, and then there was this knee surgery thing a few years back – too much wear on the joints, the doc said. The knee thing would've been, I don't know, seven or eight years ago? Time flies when you're having fun, right?|Head injuries, huh? Well, I've had my bell rung a few times. Nothing that landed me in the ER, mind you, but there've been a couple of knocks. Most memorable one was a fall off a ladder at work, oh, must've been over a decade ago now. Shook me up pretty good, but I was back on my feet in no time. No official concussion diagnosis or anything, just took it easy for a bit afterward. Life's bumps and bruises, you know?|No, seizures haven't been part of the mix for me. It's been a wild ride with everything else, but thankfully, that's one thing I haven't had to deal with.|Yeah, there's been a stint or two in the realm of trying to get a handle on the substance side of things. Went through a program, oh, a handful of years back, aimed at getting a grip on the drinking. It was one of those outpatient deals, you know? Meetings, talking, sharing - the whole nine yards. Can't say I remember the exact dates, but it was a serious enough attempt to straighten out a bit. It's a day-by-day sort of deal, always is.|Well, over the years, I've seen a bit of a lineup. There's been the occasional visit to a GP for the ups and downs that didn't quite fit the mental health or substance use tags. Then there was a therapist or two, or maybe more, trying to untangle the mess upstairs. This was all sprinkled throughout the last decade or so, give or take. The why is probably what you'd expect – trying to find some balance, some peace of mind, something resembling normalcy, whatever that means. Each of them had their own take on the situation, their own methods. Some clicked more than others. It's been a bit of a patchwork approach, trying to stitch together a solution that holds.|Yeah, the family tree's got its share of twisted branches, you might say. There's a bit of a history there, with mood swings and dark clouds hanging over a few heads. My mom, for instance, she had her battles, though it was a different time, you know? Not much in the way of talking about it or getting help. She just soldiered on, the way folks did. And then there's a cousin who definitely rode the same roller coaster, got some help, medication, therapy, the works. It's like there's a thread that runs through us, some more tangled than others. Makes you wonder about the hand you're dealt, doesn't it?|Not much on the neurological or genetic front that I'm aware of, at least not in the way of diagnosed conditions or anything like that. Seems like the mind's maze has been the main battleground for us, more than the body's mechanics. No tales of rare disorders or specific treatments for such things in the family lore. Just the usual wear and tear of life, with a heavier dose of the mental health struggles thrown in for good measure.|Ah, siblings. That's a bit of a sensitive spot, you know? Let's just say our paths diverged a good while back. Keeping those cards close to my chest, if you don't mind. It's one of those areas where the less said, the better, for everyone involved. Life's complicated enough without stirring up the sediment, right? Let's just focus on me and the here and now. That's plenty to unpack as it is.|Born and raised right here in Canada. Never had the plot twist of arriving from somewhere else. It's been British Columbia from the start. Quite the scenic backdrop for the ups and downs, I must say. So, no grand tales of crossing borders or adapting to new lands for me. Just the same old scenery, with a few internal landscapes changing over the years.|Yeah, Canadian through and through. Born here, bred here, and barring any unforeseen adventures, probably gonna stay here. It's home, with all its quirks and comforts.|No, nothing like that on my end. As far as I've been told, it was a pretty standard entry into the world. No dramatic stories or complications to add to the mix. Just another day, another baby, you know? Life started out on a pretty regular note, at least in that sense.|Ah, the early years. Well, let's just say I wasn't exactly the poster child for early development milestones. Took my sweet time with the talking and walking, a bit of a late bloomer, you might say. As for friendships, never was much of a social butterfly. I kept to myself a lot, had a hard time fitting in, you know? The whole making friends thing just didn't come naturally to me. Always felt a bit on the outside looking in, even from a young age.|Elementary school, yeah, that was a trip. Not exactly my glory days, if you catch my drift. Struggled a bit academically, couldn't quite get the hang of things or see the point of it all. And socially, well, let's just say I wasn't winning any popularity contests. Always felt a bit like an alien, like everyone else got a handbook on how to be a human, and mine got lost in the mail. Teachers tried, I guess, but I was a bit of a puzzle to them, one of those kids who just didn't fit the mold. Made it through, but can't say I look back on it fondly. It was more about survival than anything else.|Yeah, there's been some rough patches, bits of the path that were more like stumbling through brambles than walking on a road. But you know, it's tough to just lay it all out there, even after all this time. There's stuff that sticks with you, shadows that follow you around. Had my share of knocks and scrapes, inside and out. Some things, well, they don't just fade with time, not completely. But I'm not much for airing the dirty laundry, even if it's pretty well-known around the parts of my life that have seen better days. Let's just say life's been a teacher, and not all lessons were gentle or kind.|High school, now that's a chapter. Didn't exactly play out to the end, if you get what I mean. Dropped out before the whole graduation ceremony and cap-throwing bit. As for marks, let's just say they weren't anything to write home about. I was more the type to be figuring out how things worked on my own or questioning why we were learning something instead of just absorbing it and spitting it back out on tests. Favorite subject? Hard to say. I had a bit of a thing for figuring out how stuff worked, so maybe something in the realm of physics or tech, but the whole school environment just didn't jive with me. It was like trying to read a book in a language I didn't quite understand.|After high school, yeah, I took a bit of a different path. Went into more hands-on training, you could say. Found myself gravitating towards the practical, the tangible. Ended up in the world of manufacturing systems, where you can actually see the results of your work, feel the gears turn, so to speak. Got some training in that field, learned on the job. It's one thing to sit in a classroom and talk theory, another entirely to get your hands dirty and make something that works. That's where I found my groove, in the doing and the making. It felt more real to me, more like learning than any classroom ever did.|Before landing where I am now, I bounced around a bit, trying to find a fit. Worked for a couple of smaller manufacturing outfits, you know, those places that are big enough to have some complexity to them but small enough that you can really get your hands into everything. Spent a few years at one place, then a couple at another. Each move was a step up, or at least a step in a direction that seemed right at the time. Learned a lot, not just about the work but about what I wanted and, just as importantly, what I didn't. Can't say I remember all the names of those places; they tend to blend together after a while. But each one taught me something, got me a bit closer to where I needed to be. It's been a journey, that's for sure, full of twists and turns, but it led me here, and I can't complain about that.|Long-term relationships, yeah, had a go at those. Never made it down the aisle, though. It's one of those things, isn't it? You try to connect, to build something that lasts, but sometimes it just doesn't stick the way you hope it would. Had a couple of significant ones, attempts at sharing a life with someone else. But, for one reason or another, they didn't pan out. Maybe it's me, maybe it's just how the cards fall. Either way, I've been riding solo for a bit now. It's not all bad, gives you a certain freedom, but yeah, there've been times I thought maybe this time it'd be different. Life's funny like that, keeps you guessing.|Hobbies, yeah, got a few of those. Always been a bit of a tinkerer, you know? Give me something broken, and I'll sit there until it's either fixed or I've learned something new trying. Then there's the outdoors. British Columbia's got no shortage of scenery to get lost in, so I do a bit of hiking when the mood strikes. Nothing too extreme, just enough to clear the head and remind myself there's a world out there beyond the four walls of work or home.

And, well, I've dabbled in a bit of photography. Nothing professional, but there's something about trying to capture a moment, a slice of the world, that's kind of appealing. It's like you're freezing time, just for a second, showing others how you see things. Between those bits and pieces, I keep myself pretty occupied. Always something to do, something to fix, or something to explore.|On those tougher days, the ones where it feels like everything's just a bit too much, I tend to lean into the quiet moments. A long walk, especially somewhere I can just be part of the landscape, helps. There's something about putting one foot in front of the other, feeling the ground beneath you, that brings a bit of peace. Or diving into a project, something I can lose myself in, where the focus narrows down to just the task at hand. It's therapeutic, in a way, keeps the mind off the whirlwind.

And then, sometimes, just sitting with a good piece of music, letting it wash over me. Music has this way of hitting where words can't, you know? It's like it sneaks past the defenses and does its work in the shadows. Between those things, I can usually find my way back to center, or close enough to it to keep moving forward.|I guess the main thing is that, despite the ups and downs, I'm still here, still trying. Some days are better than others, and sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions, but I haven't given up. It's important to me that the doc understands that. I might come off as cynical or resistant at times, but it's more about being cautious, you know? Been down a few dead ends before, so I'm a bit wary of where I step now.

And, I suppose, it's worth mentioning that I'm open to trying new approaches or revisiting old ones if there's a sense that it might lead somewhere positive. Just because I've been around the block a few times doesn't mean I've seen everything there is to see. So, yeah, just that I'm still in the game, still looking for that bit of light, however faint it might be.",0.22783531194746148,381|88|108|91|16|103|107|131|334|360|239|418|86|372|235|296|210|268|481|820|513|672|418|154|440|667|606|436|394|354|167|270|451|598|607|689|617|817|636|845|830|801,407.76190476190476

Do you have any specialists or general practitioners you see regularly?|I see, it's important to have someone to turn to when needed. Do you have any known allergies?|It's good to be aware of those allergies for your safety.

It's understandable that it feels like a constant concern. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that we should be aware of?|It's clear you've had to navigate some challenging experiences with your health. Let's talk about your history of head injuries or concussions. Have you experienced any, and if so, could you share when and how they occurred?|I'm glad to hear there haven't been any recent incidents. It's important to take care of yourself, especially after experiences like those. Have you had a history of seizures, and if so, when did they start?|Thank you for reiterating that, Rebecca. It's indeed a careful balance managing seizures. Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling, and if so, where and when?|It's incredibly brave of you to confront these challenges and seek help to improve your situation. It's a significant step towards healing and growth, even though it can feel overwhelming at times. Have you consulted any other medical professionals for your health concerns, and if so, could you share who, when, and why?|Your journey through various treatments and consultations shows a lot of strength and persistence, Rebecca. It's understandable that remembering every detail can be challenging. Let's shift our focus to your family history. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members, and if so, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It sounds like mental health and substance use challenges have touched your family in significant ways. It's insightful to recognize patterns and consider both genetic and environmental factors. Regarding your family, is there a history of neurological or genetic conditions, and if so, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|Thank you for sharing that, Rebecca. It's important to acknowledge how perceptions and treatments of neurological and genetic conditions have evolved over time. Now, could you tell me about your siblings? If you have any, I'd like to know each sibling's basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation.|Absolutely, Rebecca. We respect your privacy and the privacy of your family. Let's move on to your personal history. Could you tell me where you were born? If it was outside Canada, could you also share the year of your arrival?|It's great to have that continuity of being in one country. Are you a Canadian citizen then?|Thank you for confirming that, Rebecca. Were there any complications during your birth that you're aware of?|I appreciate you sharing what you know about your birth. It's true that perspectives and practices around childbirth have evolved. Moving on, at a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids, or were there any notable differences?|It sounds like those early years presented some challenges for you, but also shaped who you are. Difficulties in fitting in can be tough, especially as a child. How about your experiences in elementary school? Did you face any particular difficulties there?|It must have been incredibly challenging to navigate those feelings of isolation and struggle during your elementary school years. Those experiences can be very impactful. Moving forward, did you have any traumatic experiences growing up that you feel comfortable sharing?|Thank you for sharing that with me, Rebecca. It's understandable that revisiting those experiences is difficult. Focusing on moving forward is a resilient approach. To continue, could you tell me about your average mark and favorite topic or class in high school?|Art class sounds like it was a valuable outlet for you, offering a space to express yourself and find some solace during those years. After high school, did you pursue any further education or training? If yes, where and what type of studies?|It sounds like you've gained a lot of valuable experience through the various jobs and life lessons along the way. Speaking of work, could you share a bit about your previous work history, such as companies you've worked for and years of work?|Your diverse work experience certainly reflects adaptability and resilience, Rebecca. It's interesting to hear about the variety of roles you've taken on. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?|Navigating relationships can indeed be complex, and finding the right balance for oneself is important. Your experiences and insights are valuable. Let's shift gears a bit. What are some hobbies or activities you enjoy?|Your hobbies sound wonderfully therapeutic and fulfilling, providing a sense of peace and a creative outlet. It's great that you have found activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Speaking of relaxation, what do you do to relax on a stressful day?|It sounds like you have a healthy variety of strategies to cope with stress and find moments of calm in your day. Your approach to self-care and finding what works for you is commendable. 

Before we conclude, is there anything else you feel the doctor should know about your health, well-being, or any aspect of your life that we haven't covered?|Rebecca, sharing your story, your struggles, and your hope for the future is a significant step, and it's been an honor to listen. Acknowledging the need for help and taking steps towards it shows incredible strength. Your efforts to move forward, your willingness to consider opening up, and your hope for things to get better are all very powerful.

Yeah, sure, I guess we can talk a bit. I'm not too sure what good it'll do, talking to doctors hasn't really been my cup of tea, you know? They seem to just nod and scribble stuff down, but alright, let's give this a shot. What do you wanna know?|Yeah, it's Rebecca Jillian Smith. That's the name they've got on all the forms and stuff, so that's me.|Rebecca's fine, I guess. No one really bothers with nicknames or anything for me. Just Rebecca.|Sure, it's November 24, 1962. Makes me a Sagittarius, not that I put much stock in all that star stuff. My life's been more about dealing with the here and now, you know?|I'm female. Been dealing with all that comes with that for 61 years now.|I'm living in Acostatown, British Columbia. Got a little place at 898 Anderson Isle Suite 649. It's quiet, I guess. Keeps me out of trouble, or that's the idea anyway.|I'm in something casual, not really tied down. It's complicated, you know? Never been much for labels or making things official. Life's too messy for that.|Yeah, I've got kids. They're all grown up now, doing their own thing. It's just me most of the time these days. They come around or call when they can, you know how it is. Life gets busy.|Oh, you know, I'd rather not drag them into all this. They've got their lives, and I've got my... stuff. Let's just say they're adults and leave it at that, alright? They don't need their names in some doctor's notes.|Nope, not working. Been unemployed for a bit now. It's tough out there, and with my own... issues, it's been hard to hold anything down. Plus, who's gonna hire someone my age with my kind of history, right?|Nah, I haven't gone down that road yet. It's all a big mess of paperwork and hoops to jump through. Feels like they make it complicated on purpose, you know? Plus, I've got a bit of a stubborn streak. Been trying to manage on my own, for better or worse.|I'm right-handed. Always have been. It's the one thing that's been straightforward about me, I guess.|Doctors, huh? Well, I've seen a few over the years, but it's like I said, never felt like they really got what was going on with me. I've got Dr. Michael Tran, obviously, since you're asking for him. But regularly? Nah, I don't do regular check-ups or anything. Just when things get too much to handle on my own, I guess.|Yeah, a few actually. Opioid pain meds, latex, and fragrances. Makes it a bit tricky with hospitals and doctors' offices, you know? Always have to be on guard with that stuff.|Oh, right. I'm on Zolof for my mood, you know? Helps a bit, I suppose. Keeps the edges from getting too sharp. But the dosage and all that, I'd have to check the bottle. I'm not great with numbers and details like that.|No, no supplements. Just the Zoloft. I've heard all sorts of things about vitamins and whatnot, but never got into it. Seems like another thing to keep track of, and I've got enough on my plate as it is.|Well, I've had my rounds with all that. Used to smoke, but I gave it up. Alcohol, it's here and there. Not much of a drinker these days. Marijuana, well, it's legal here, isn't it? Might partake occasionally, helps take the edge off, but it's not a daily thing. And then there's the other stuff, but that's all in the past now. Been trying to keep clean, you know?|Oh, where do I start? I've got this binge-eating thing. Been dealing with it for years, but got officially slapped with that label a while back. Can't remember exactly when. It's like, sometimes food's the only thing that makes sense, you know? Then there's the seizures. Had a few of those scary moments. They say it's under control, but it feels like a ticking time bomb sometimes. And well, there's the mood stuff, hence the Zoloft. Been on and off things for that for years. Plus, all the stuff life's thrown my way, it's a wonder I'm still kicking. Substance issues, too, but like I said, trying to keep that in the rearview. And yeah, developmental stuff from way back when, but who's counting anymore?|The seizures, yeah, they started a good while back. I'd say it's been a decade or so? It's all a bit fuzzy. They had me on some meds for it at one point, but it's been a bit of a balancing act, what with everything else going on. Mostly, it's just been about trying to avoid triggers, you know? Stress, lack of sleep, that sort of thing. But it's not like you can just put life on pause. Managed, I guess, but it's always there in the back of my mind.|Hospitalizations, yeah, a few. Mostly related to the seizures or when things got really bad with my eating. No surgeries, though. It's mostly been about trying to manage things with medication and what they call ""lifestyle changes."" Feels like I've spent enough time in hospitals to last a lifetime. Always a bit nerve-wracking, what with my allergies and all. But no surgeries, no. Just lots of tests, talks, and too many waiting rooms.|Head injuries, huh? Well, I've had a couple of knocks here and there. Nothing too serious, I guess. Had a fall a few years back, slipped on some ice. Ended up with a bit of a concussion, had a headache for days. Then there was another time, way back, can't even remember how it happened. Just know I ended up in the ER with a pretty bad headache. They did scans and all that, said I was fine, but it shook me up pretty good. Haven't had anything like that recently, thankfully. Life's rough enough without adding brain injuries to the mix.|Yeah, like I mentioned before, the seizures started about a decade ago. It's been a bit of a journey, dealing with them. They kind of came out of nowhere, scared me and everyone else pretty good. Been trying to manage them ever since, with the meds and avoiding triggers. It's a bit of a tightrope walk, you know? Always having to be careful, but that's just how it is.|Yeah, I've been through the whole rehab thing a couple of times. Substance counseling, too. It's all part of trying to get a handle on things, you know? The first time was quite a few years back, can't remember exactly when. Then again, more recently. It's tough, facing all that. But I guess it's part of trying to do better, trying to be better. It's not easy, talking about all this stuff, digging up the past. But I guess it's supposed to help, right? Just feels like a lot sometimes.|Oh, I've seen a few over the years. Different doctors for different things. There was a nutritionist for the binge-eating, that was a couple of years ago. Tried to help me get my eating habits in order, you know? Then there's been a few different therapists and counselors for the mood stuff and the substance issues. And the neurologist for the seizures, of course. It's been a bit of a revolving door, seeing all these specialists. Sometimes it feels like they're just throwing solutions at the wall to see what sticks. Can't say I remember all their names or the exact dates. It's all a blur of appointments and advice. Some of it helps, some of it doesn't. Just trying to keep moving forward, I guess.|Family history, yeah, there's some of that. My mom had her own set of troubles. Depression, I think they called it. She was in and out of the doctor's office, took a lot of different pills over the years. Never seemed to get much better, though. And my brother, he's had his run-ins with substance stuff too, went through rehab a couple of times. It's like this stuff just runs in the family, you know? Not sure if it's the genes or just bad luck. They got some help, sure, but it's hard to say if it did much good. Seems like we've all been fighting our own battles, one way or another.|Neurological or genetic stuff, that's a bit harder to pin down. I mean, my granddad had something going on, some kind of dementia in his later years. Not sure if that counts. He was pretty old, and back then, people just said he was ""getting senile"" or whatever. Don't think he got much in the way of treatment, just kind of faded away with it. And there might've been some talk about an aunt or cousin with epilepsy, but that's not something we talked much about in the family. It's like once someone's got a label, that's all anyone sees, you know? So, we didn't dig too deep into it, just dealt with things as they came.|Oh, my siblings, yeah. Well, there's my brother, like I mentioned. He's been through his own share of troubles. But getting into all their names, ages, and what they do, I'd rather not get too into the specifics, you know? They've got their lives, and with everything going on, I don't want to drag them into my mess more than necessary. They're out there, doing their best, just like I am. We try to keep in touch, support each other when we can. But yeah, let's leave it at that, if that's alright.|I was born right here in Canada. Never had to deal with moving countries or anything like that. Just been moving around within the same borders, you know? Different towns, different challenges. But yeah, Canadian through and through, from the start.|Yeah, I'm a Canadian citizen. Born and raised, like I said. It's been an interesting ride, but this is home, through and through.|Complications during my birth? Yeah, I think my mom mentioned something about it being a tough delivery. Took a long time, and there were some worries, but in the end, I made it here alright. Don't know all the details, just that it wasn't easy for her. Things were different back then, not as much talk about what went wrong, just gratitude for what went right, I guess.|Oh, well, growing up was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I was always a bit on the slow side, you know? Took me a while to get the hang of talking and walking. My folks were worried for a bit, thought maybe something was wrong. And making friends, that wasn't easy either. I was the quiet one, kind of kept to myself. Had a hard time fitting in, always felt a bit out of step with the other kids. It's like I was marching to a beat only I could hear. School was tough, too, never really caught on like the others. Just felt different, I guess.|Elementary school, yeah, that was rough. Like I said, I was always a bit behind, felt like I was playing catch-up. Reading and math, those were tough. I remember feeling pretty lost most of the time. Teachers tried to help, but I just couldn't seem to get it. And the other kids, well, kids can be mean when you're not like them. Got picked on a bit for being slow. It was a lonely time, made me dread going to school. Just didn't fit in, no matter how hard I tried. Ended up keeping to myself a lot, just waiting for the day to be over so I could go home.|Yeah, there were a few things, I guess. Life wasn't always kind. My family, we had our share of troubles. Money was tight, and there was a lot of arguing at home. That kind of tension, it sticks with you, you know? And then, well, there was this one time, something bad happened with a family friend. I don't really like to talk about it much. It's one of those things that's hard to shake off, even after all these years. Made me see the world a bit differently, trust people a lot less. And then just the usual scrapes and bruises life throws at you. It's been a journey, that's for sure. But talking about it, dredging it all up, that's tough. I prefer to try and keep looking forward, best I can.|High school, huh? Well, my marks weren't anything to brag about. I was pretty much scraping by, you know? Just doing enough to get through. As for a favorite topic or class, that's a tough one. Never really felt like I belonged in any of them. But if I had to pick, maybe art class was okay. It was one of the few places I didn't feel completely out of my depth. Didn't matter if you were good at it or not, you could just sort of lose yourself in whatever you were working on. It was a break from everything else, at least for a little while. But yeah, school was mostly just something to get through, not something I enjoyed.|No, I didn't go for any further education or training after high school. Once I was done, I was just done, you know? The thought of sitting in more classes, trying to keep up, it just wasn't for me. I jumped into working, just odd jobs here and there. Nothing that really needed any special training or education. I've picked up things along the way, learned from the school of hard knocks, I guess you could say. Life's been my teacher, throwing lessons at me whether I wanted them or not. But formal education, college, or anything like that, it just wasn't in the cards.|Oh, my work history's a bit all over the place. I've done a bunch of different things, never really stayed in one spot too long. Let's see, I worked at a grocery store for a while, stocking shelves and working the cash register. That was a few years back. Then there was a stint at a local diner, waiting tables. Met a lot of interesting folks there. I've also done some cleaning jobs, offices, and such at night. It's quiet work, keeps you to yourself.

As for companies, they're mostly just small local businesses, nothing big or fancy. And the years, well, it's hard to keep track. I've been bouncing around different jobs since I left high school. It's been a mix of part-time and full-time, whatever I could get my hands on to pay the bills and keep going. It's been a bit of a scramble, but that's life, right? Always something new around the corner.|Yeah, there's been a couple of attempts at that whole long-term relationship thing. Was married once, a long time ago. It didn't work out, though. We were young, thought we knew what we were doing, but life has a way of showing you otherwise. After that, there were a few relationships, nothing that stuck, though. It's hard, you know? Finding someone who gets you, who's willing to ride out the storms with you. These days, I'm in something casual, like I mentioned. It's easier, less pressure. But yeah, I've had my share of trying and hoping. Just haven't found that ""forever"" kind of thing. Life's complicated, and so am I, I guess.|Hobbies, huh? Well, I've always had a bit of a thing for gardening. There's something about working with your hands, watching things grow, that's kind of soothing, you know? It's like, no matter what's going on, the plants just do their thing, grow, bloom, fade, and start all over again. It's grounding, in a way.

Then there's walking. I like to take long walks, just me and my thoughts, sometimes not even that. It's a way to clear my head, get a bit of peace. The world's so noisy, it's nice to find a bit of quiet now and then.

And art, like I mentioned before, it's always been a bit of an escape for me. I'm not what you'd call talented, but I like messing around with paints and stuff. It's not about making something great, just making something, you know? It's a way to let out whatever's bottled up inside without having to put it into words.

So yeah, gardening, walking, and a bit of painting. Nothing fancy, but it's what I like.|On a stressful day, huh? Well, besides the walking and the gardening, I guess there's a few things. Music's a big one for me. Just putting on some tunes and letting myself get lost in it. Doesn't really matter what kind, as long as it's got a good beat or a melody that catches me. Sometimes I just sit and listen, other times it's more about blasting it and maybe dancing around a bit, just letting go.

Then there's reading. I'm not one for heavy stuff, but a good story, something that takes me away from it all for a while, that can be real nice. Gives my mind a break from running in circles.

And, well, sometimes it's about turning everything off, sitting with a cup of tea, and just being. No distractions, no noise, just a bit of quiet. Doesn't always work, mind you, but when it does, it's like a little reset button.

So yeah, music, reading, and a bit of quiet. That's my recipe for trying to unwind after a tough day.|Well, I guess the main thing is just that life's been a bit of a rollercoaster, you know? And sometimes, I feel like I'm just barely hanging on. The eating thing, the mood swings, the past stuff, it all just piles up. And I'm trying, really trying, to keep moving forward, but some days it feels like I'm stuck in the same old patterns.

I'm not great at asking for help, always been more of a ""deal with it on your own"" kind of person. But I'm starting to realize maybe that's not enough anymore. It's hard, though, opening up, trusting that someone might actually be able to help without just judging or giving up on me.

So, I guess what I want the doctor to know is that I'm here, I'm trying, and I'm hoping maybe this time will be different. Maybe this time, something will click, and things will start to get a bit better. But it's a big maybe, and it's scary to even think about getting my hopes up.

Anyway, thanks for listening, or, well, reading, I guess. It's been a lot, dumping all this out, but maybe it's a start, right?",0.1871096677491881,263|103|95|170|72|167|155|187|217|206|254|101|321|175|219|203|364|708|451|437|539|369|488|705|587|623|500|249|129|371|540|556|700|627|573|856|636|944|930|1035,420.625

Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?|Relationships can indeed be complex, and it's important to find the right balance. What are your hobbies? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?|Finding peace and managing your headspace are important. When you have a stressful day, what do you do to relax?|It's good to have strategies that help, even while recognizing there's always room for healthier coping mechanisms. Is there anything else you think the doctor needs to know that we haven't covered yet?|I understand, Seth. It's important to communicate these feelings, and seeking help is a positive step forward.

What do you need to know?|Seth Robert Rhodes|Just Seth is fine.|June 2, 1971.|Male.|East Jonathanside, British Columbia.|In a casual relationship.|No, none.|Yeah, I work for a charity organization as an administrator. Been there for about 8 years now.|Yes, I do. Got disability assistance because of my conditions. Started a few years back, can't remember exactly when. Keeps things a bit more manageable, you know?|Right-handed.|Honestly, it's a bit of a blur. I see Dr. Michelle Price, obviously. Then there's a couple of others whose names I always mix up. One's for my head stuff, another checks on the meds. It's a bit much to keep straight.|Yeah, pet dander. Gets me sneezing and all that.|I'm on Ritalan, Olanzapine, and Clozapine. Dosages, uh, not sure of the exact numbers. They keep changing them trying to find what works.|No, no supplements. Just the meds they've got me on.|Alcohol, yeah, it's there. Not much of a smoker or anything. Drink more often than I probably should, helps take the edge off, you know?|Got a few labels they've stuck on me over the years. ADHD, that was when I was pretty young. Then there's borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia. Those came later, in my 20s and 30s. It's a mix, makes things... interesting.|Yeah, been in the hospital a few times. Couple of stays were for my mental health, trying to get things under control. No surgeries, though. Just those stays to adjust meds and stuff.|No head injuries or concussions. Been lucky there, I guess.|No seizures either.|Yeah, had to deal with the drinking. Went through a program, what, two years ago? It was local, here in East Jonathanside. Helped some, I guess. Keeps me a bit more in line.|Aside from the mental health stuff, not really. I've been pretty focused on managing the conditions you already know about. So, it's mostly just been psychiatrists and therapists for that. No one else comes to mind.|Yeah, there's some history there. My mom had depression, pretty bad. She was in and out of treatment for most of her life. And I think an uncle on my dad's side had something, schizophrenia maybe? Not sure if he ever got proper treatment. It's not talked about much.|No neurological or genetic stuff that I'm aware of. Just the mental health issues seem to run in the family. No one's mentioned anything else.|No siblings. It's just been me.|Born right here in British Columbia, Canada.|Not that I've ever been told. Seems it was all pretty standard, no big issues.|Yeah, I guess I was a bit slower on some of those fronts. Had trouble keeping friends, and they said I was always a bit more in my own world. ADHD diagnosis came because I couldn't sit still or focus much.|Was average, I suppose. Struggled to pay attention, got into trouble for daydreaming or not following instructions. Teachers always said I could do better if I just focused more. Classic ADHD stuff, really.|No, nothing traumatic. Life's had its ups and downs, but no big traumas or anything. Just the usual stuff, you know?|Marks were poor, honestly. Never really had a favorite class. School just wasn't my thing. Hard to stay interested or motivated with everything else going on in my head.|No, didn't go for more schooling after high school. Jumped straight into work. School environment was tough for me, didn't see the point in continuing that struggle.|Worked a few different jobs before landing where I am now. Mostly retail and a bit of manual labor. None of it really stuck until I got into the charity work. Been here about 8 years, like I mentioned. The other jobs were just jobs, nothing I'd call a career.|Had a couple of long-term things, but nothing that stuck. No marriages. Just wasn't in the cards, I guess. Relationships can be tough with everything going on in my head.|Not much for hobbies. Sometimes I'll read or watch something if it catches my interest. Mostly just try to keep things quiet, helps with managing my head space.|Drink, mostly. I know, not the best coping mechanism. Sometimes just sitting alone, trying to clear my head. Not much into exercise or anything. Just quiet and space, I guess.|Don't think so. You've got the gist of it. Just tired of feeling like this, you know?

It seemed like a good way to blend my interests and help people, you know?|Before I settled into art therapy, I did a few internships related to psychology and art programs.

If yes, could you please provide the name of the company and how many years you've been working there?|That sounds like a fascinating career. Do you receive any form of disability assistance? If yes, could you specify what type and when it began?|Okay, noted. What about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or do you use both hands equally?|Thank you for sharing that. Can you tell me about your current doctors? This could include general practitioners, specialists, or any other medical professionals you're seeing regularly.|I understand, and I'm glad you're seeking support. It's important to address these concerns. Do you have any known allergies?|Noted, allergies to pet dander. Are you currently taking any medications or health supplements? If so, could you please specify what they are and the dosage?|It's important for us to know the exact dosage of Paxil you're taking. Could you take a moment to check the dosage on your medication package?|Thank you for checking that, Sam. How often do you take the 20mg of Paxil?|Got it, once daily in the morning. Could you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use?|I appreciate your candor, Sam. Let's move on to your medical history. 

Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions? If so, could you provide details such as when you were diagnosed?|I understand, it can feel like a constant presence. Even if you don't remember the exact date, would you say it was more than five years ago that you were diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder?|Thank you for sharing that, Sam. It's important to acknowledge how these experiences feel. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries? If so, could you provide some details?|That's good to hear. Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions? If yes, could you tell me when and how it happened?|It's good to know you've been safe from those kinds of injuries. Have you ever had a history of seizures? If yes, when did they start?|I'm sorry to hear that, seizures can be quite concerning. Could you specify a bit more about when they first started? Would you say it was within the last five years?|Thank you for clarifying. Have you ever undergone rehabilitation or received substance counseling? If yes, could you tell me where and when?|It's good to hear you've managed to avoid those issues. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health concerns? If yes, who were they, when did you see them, and why?|I understand that it can sometimes feel like healthcare professionals don't fully grasp what you're going through. Let's move on to your family history.

Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who were they, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|It sounds like mental health wasn't openly discussed in your family, which is not uncommon. Thank you for sharing what you could. 

Is there a family history of neurological or genetic conditions? If yes, who had them, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?|I see, it seems privacy about health matters was a norm in your family. How about siblings? Do you have any brothers or sisters? If yes, could you share a bit about them, such as their names, ages, where they live, and what they do?|Being an only child does have its unique set of experiences. Thank you for sharing that, Sam. Let's move on to your personal history.

Where were you born? If it was outside Canada, could you tell me the year of your arrival?|Thank you for that detail. Are you a Canadian citizen then?|Great, thank you for confirming. Were there any complications during your birth that you're aware of?|That's good to know. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age?|It sounds like you had a relatively typical childhood with a bit of an introverted streak. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school, either academically or socially?|I'm sorry to hear that school was challenging. It's not uncommon for academic and social difficulties to impact each other. Moving forward, did you have any traumatic experiences growing up that you feel comfortable sharing?|It's good to hear there weren't significant traumas. How about your performance in high school? Could you share your average mark and favorite subject or class?|I see, school can indeed be challenging for many. Since you mentioned dropping out of high school, did you pursue any further education or training after leaving?|It's impressive how you've carved out a successful career for yourself in theatre work through on-the-job learning. Could you share a bit about your previous work history before settling into your current role as a theatre stage manager?|Your journey sounds both interesting and rewarding, having gained a broad experience across different aspects of theatre production before becoming a stage manager. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?|Balancing personal life with work, especially in a demanding field like theatre, can indeed be challenging. What are some of your hobbies or interests outside of work?|It sounds like you've found some peaceful activities that help you unwind. Reading and photography can be very soothing and fulfilling hobbies. On a stressful day, what do you usually do to relax?|Finding those moments of peace and distraction can be very beneficial, especially when dealing with anxiety. Music, walks, and reading are great ways to manage stress. 

Before we conclude, is there anything else you feel the doctor should know about your situation or health that we haven't covered?|Your effort to seek help and willingness to try is a significant step, and it's important to acknowledge that. Everyone has their own pace and way of dealing with challenges, and it's okay to have mixed feelings about discussing personal matters. Dr. Le will be there to support and work with you through this process. Thank you, Sam, for taking the time to share this information with me today. Your openness is greatly appreciated, and this will be very helpful for your upcoming appointment. 

If there's nothing else you wish to add, I believe we've covered everything necessary for now.

Didn't do well, grades were poor. Just couldn't seem to focus or get the hang of it. Made it hard to fit in, too.|No, nothing traumatic. Just the usual ups and downs, but nothing that sticks out as trauma.|Didn't make it through high school. Dropped out. School just wasn't for me. Never had a favorite subject, was just trying to get through each day.|No, jumped straight into work. Found my way into theatre work and just stuck with it. Learned everything on the job.|Started off doing odd jobs around the theatre, you know, helping with sets, lighting, that sort of thing. Worked my way up slowly. Did a bit of everything before landing the stage manager gig. It's been a long road, but I like where I ended up.|No, never married. Had a couple of long-term relationships, but nothing that stuck. Always found it hard to balance personal life with the demands of the job.|Don't have a lot of free time, but when I do, I like to keep it simple. Reading, a bit of photography. Enjoy the quiet moments, you know? Helps to calm the mind a bit.|Usually just zone out with some music or go for a walk. Anything to get out of my head for a bit. Sometimes, I'll dive into a book if I can focus enough. Keeps the anxiety at bay, at least for a little while.|Not really sure what else to say. Just that, you know, some days are better than others.
