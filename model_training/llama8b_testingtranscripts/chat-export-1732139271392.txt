Hello

### ASSISTANT
Hello! Welcome to our psychiatric intake interview. My name is Dr. Smith, and I'll be conducting this session today. Please make yourself comfortable.

To start, could you tell me your full name? And if you prefer a nickname or go by a different name, that's okay too - what would you like us to use for the rest of our conversation?

### USER
Clarisa Mora Reig, but you can call me Clarisa.

### ASSISTANT
Nice to meet you, Clarisa! Now, let's move on to some general information.

Could you please tell me your date of birth and sex? This is just for our records, so don't worry if it feels a bit personal.

### USER
My date of birth is November 29 1960, and my sex is Female

### ASSISTANT
Great, thank you Clarisa! And can you also tell me which hand you prefer to use? Do you write, eat, or perform other activities with your left hand, right hand, both hands equally, or does it vary depending on the activity?

### USER
I'm right handed

### ASSISTANT
So, we have that noted. Now, let's move on to your residence and marital status.

Could you tell me where you currently live, which city or town would you like to mention? And are you single, in a relationship, married, common law, or something else?

### USER
I live in Rodriguezville, and I am in a long term relationship

### ASSISTANT
Rodriguezville is a specific location, so that's helpful for our records.

So, it sounds like you're in a committed relationship. Are there any children or dependents involved in your life? If yes, could you tell me their names and ages?

### USER
No, I don't have any children

### ASSISTANT
That helps to clarify that aspect of your personal life.

Now, let's move on to your employment and financial status. Are you currently working, either full-time or part-time? If so, could you tell me the name of the company or organization where you work, and approximately how long you've been employed there?

### USER
No, I am unemployed

### ASSISTANT
Not being actively employed can be a challenging situation for many people. Don't worry, this information is just to help us understand your current circumstances.

Are you receiving any form of disability assistance or financial support at the moment? And if so, what type and when did it start?

### USER
No, I don't have and disability assistance

### ASSISTANT
So, that's helpful for our records. Now, let's talk about your medical care information.

Do you currently see any doctors or healthcare professionals on a regular basis? And if so, could you tell me their names and what kind of care they provide?

### USER
I currently see two doctors, Dr. Rachel Kim and Dr. Eric Taylor

### ASSISTANT
So, you have a relationship with both a primary care physician (Dr. Kim) and possibly another specialist (Dr. Taylor). That's good to know.

Can you tell me if you have any allergies or sensitivities that we should be aware of? And do you take any medications currently, either prescription or over-the-counter? If so, what are they and in what dosage?

### USER
I have allergies to acetaminophen, latex, and pet dander

### ASSISTANT
Thank you for sharing that information. Those are some specific allergies, especially the latex one.

Regarding your medications, can you tell me if you're currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications regularly? If so, please list them out along with their dosages.

Also, do you take any health supplements on a regular basis, such as vitamins or minerals?

### USER
I'm taking Paxil

### ASSISTANT
So, it sounds like you're currently being treated for some mental health-related issues. Don't worry, this is completely confidential and just part of our intake process.

Paxil is an antidepressant medication, and I'll make a note of that in your file.

Can you tell me how often you consume nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol? This can help us understand any potential contributing factors to your mental health.

### USER
It's hard for me to talk about this, but... I have used substances in the past. I'd rather not go into details, but I want to acknowledge it. As for current use, I don't think I can provide a specific frequency.

### ASSISTANT
I completely understand and respect your boundaries, Clarisa. It takes courage to acknowledge past struggles with substance use, and I appreciate your willingness to do so.

As you said, we can skip into details about the specifics of your current or past substance use. Our focus is on providing a safe and supportive environment for you to discuss any concerns or issues you'd like to address.

Let's move on to some other aspects of your life. Would you be willing to share with me any health conditions or diagnoses you've received in the past? This might include anything from chronic physical conditions to previous mental health-related diagnoses.

### USER
I have been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder, and I've also experienced some significant medical events in the past, including a severe depressive episode that required hospitalization. Additionally, there's a history of mental health conditions in my family. I want to note that these experiences have had a significant impact on my life, but I'm working to manage them with treatment and support.

### ASSISTANT
Thank you for sharing this information with me, Clarisa. It takes a lot of courage to discuss personal struggles, especially those related to mental health.

It sounds like you've faced some significant challenges in your life, including the diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder and the hospitalization for depression. I'm glad to hear that you're working with treatment and support to manage these conditions.

The fact that there's a history of mental health conditions in your family can also be an important factor to consider. Sometimes, having a supportive network and a good understanding of one's own vulnerabilities can make a big difference.

Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any siblings? If so, could you tell me their names, ages, where they live, and what they do for work or study?

### USER
I have an older brother named Michael. He's 65 years old and lives in Toronto, where he works as an accountant

### ASSISTANT
It's great that you have a sibling to support you from afar.

Let's go back to your personal history for a moment. You mentioned earlier that you were born on November 29th, 1960. Could you tell me where you were born? And if you weren't born in Canada, could you give me the year when you moved here?

### USER
I was born in Burtonton, British Columbia, Canada

### ASSISTANT
So, it seems like you have a strong connection to British Columbia and its history.

As for your early life, did you experience any significant birth complications or difficulties as an infant that might be relevant to our conversation today? And were there any concerns about your development, such as walking, talking, or forming friendships with other children, that might have been noted by your caregivers or family members?

### USER
 As far as I know, there were no significant birth complications or concerns

### ASSISTANT
So it seems like you had a relatively smooth and healthy start in life.

Let's move on to your education. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school that might be worth noting? And what were some of your favorite subjects or activities in high school? Were there any particular teachers or mentors who made a positive impact on your educational journey?

### USER
I had some developmental difficulties, but in elementary school, I performed averagely. I don't recall having any significant struggles or issues during that time.

### ASSISTANT
It's great to hear that you were able to navigate through elementary school with relative ease.

As for high school, it sounds like you didn't have any major difficulties either. Did you pursue any further education after high school, such as college or university? If so, where did you go and what type of studies did you engage in?

### USER
To be honest, I don't think I did pursue any further education after high school. It was a bit of a challenging time for me, and I didn't really have a clear direction

### ASSISTANT
It can be tough to navigate uncertain times, especially when it comes to making decisions about your future.

Let's move on to some other aspects of your life. You mentioned earlier that you're in a long-term relationship. How would you describe the dynamics of that relationship? And how does it support or impact your mental health?

Also, what do you typically do to relax and manage stress on a daily basis?

### USER
I've had two main jobs in my past. I worked as a customer service representative at Bell Canada for about 15 years, from 1980 to 1995. Later, I was employed as a part-time librarian at the University of British Columbia from 2001 to 2008.

### ASSISTANT
It sounds like you have had some meaningful and long-term employment experiences that have given you stability and purpose.

Firstly, it's impressive that you worked in customer service for 15 years, which can be a challenging yet rewarding role. Being able to provide support to customers must have been fulfilling for you.

Later, working as a part-time librarian at the University of British Columbia sounds like an ideal job, allowing you to work in a setting where you're surrounded by books and knowledge. I'm sure it was a great way to connect with people who share similar interests.

Let's move on to some final questions before we conclude our intake session today. Is there anything specific that you would like me to know or consider when working with you, either as a patient or in terms of your mental health?

Also, do you have any thoughts about what might be helpful for us to work on together during this time?

### USER
I'm not sure if there's anything else I'd like to discuss, but I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings with you. It's been helpful for me to reflect on my experiences.

### ASSISTANT
Clarisa, it was a pleasure conducting this intake session with you. I'm glad we could have this conversation and help you process some of your thoughts and feelings.

As we conclude our session today, I want to assure you that everything discussed here is completely confidential and for the purpose of providing you with the best possible care.

Before we wrap up, I would like to provide a brief summary of what we've covered. Feel free to correct me if anything seems inaccurate or incomplete.
