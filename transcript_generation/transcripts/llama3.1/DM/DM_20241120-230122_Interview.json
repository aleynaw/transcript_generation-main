        "content": "Actually, I think it might be worth mentioning my experience with fibromyalgia and how it affects my daily life. While I've learned ways to manage the chronic pain and cognitive impairment, some days are still really tough. It's not something I like to focus on too much, but understanding its impact on me could be helpful for your assessment.\n\nAdditionally, I want to thank you for creating a comfortable space where I felt open about sharing my experiences, even the difficult ones. It means a lot to have this opportunity to express myself honestly."
