Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. If yes, when did your seizures start? Can you estimate approximately how old you were or what year it was?

User: To be honest, I'm not entirely sure when my seizures started. However, I've been experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder since my early twenties, and I think the seizures might have started around that time as well. I'm guessing it was probably sometime between 2012 and 2015, but I'd need to check my medical records to confirm."

However, I have been seeing Dr. Liam Chen for my bipolar disorder, and we might have discussed some aspects of therapy or counseling during our sessions.

My siblings and I didn't really have any developmental difficulties growing up either. Since there isn't much information about this topic, I might not be entirely sure, but based on what I know, it seems like we don't have a significant family history of psychiatric conditions.
