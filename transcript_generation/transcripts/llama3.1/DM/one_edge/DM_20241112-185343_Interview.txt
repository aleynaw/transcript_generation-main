I was driving home from work when another car ran a red light and hit me. I don't remember much after that, but I do recall waking up in the hospital with a pounding headache. The doctors told me I had a mild concussion, and ever since then, I've been getting these occasional migraines. It's possible that the accident triggered something that led to my seizures, but I'm not really sure."

I also have some ongoing medical conditions, including ADHD, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, for which I'm currently taking medication. Additionally, I've had some health issues in the past, such as an appendectomy in 2001 and a mild concussion in 2008, which still causes occasional migraines. My family also has a history of health conditions, including type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. I hope this information is helpful for my doctor to know."
