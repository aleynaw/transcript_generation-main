Additionally, my family has a history of health conditions - my mother struggled with depression and anxiety disorders, my father passed away due to complications from type 2 diabetes, and my younger brother has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I also have a history of seizures, which can be quite unpredictable and scary at times.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information with me. You mentioned having a history of seizures. Could you tell me more about when your seizures first started?

User: "I'm not entirely sure when my seizures first started, but I recall having them since childhood. They've been quite unpredictable over the years, and it's hard for me to pinpoint an exact age or time frame. I think they might have started around 5-7 years old, but it's all a bit fuzzy in my memory."

User: "Yes, I have experienced seizures."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about when your seizures started?

User: "I'm not sure exactly when my seizures started, but I think it was sometime in my late 40s or early 50s. To be honest, they've been sporadic over the years, and I don't always remember when they happen."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint exact timing, but would you mind estimating approximately how many seizures you've had over the years?

User: I'm not sure exactly how many seizures I've had over the years. They've been sporadic and often unpredictable. I'd say it's happened maybe around 5-10 times in total, but I could be underestimating or overestimating - I just don't have a clear record of them.

Assistant: Thank you for trying your best to estimate. It's helpful to understand the unpredictability of your seizures. Moving on, can you tell me a bit about your family history? Specifically, have there been any instances of psychiatric conditions in other family members?

User: "Yes, there have been instances of psychiatric conditions in my family members. My mother had depression and anxiety disorders, and my younger brother has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These conditions have been present in my immediate family, but I'm not aware of any other relatives who may have struggled with similar issues."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Did any of your family members receive treatment or hospital care for their psychiatric conditions?

User: "I'm not entirely sure about the specifics, but I think my mother may have seen a therapist or counselor for her depression and anxiety disorders. As for my younger brother with ADHD, he might have received some form of treatment or therapy, possibly through his school or a specialist. However, I don't have any concrete details to confirm this."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand it can be difficult to recall specifics about family members' treatments. Let's move on to another area. You mentioned earlier your seizures started in your late 40s or early 50s. Have there been any birth complications or issues during your early development, such as difficulties walking or talking at a young age?

User: "To my knowledge, there were no birth complications or issues during my early development. I don't recall having any difficulties with walking or talking at a young age. In fact, according to my profile, I had 'No' developmental difficulties."

User: "I don't recall any specific birth complications, but my parents never mentioned anything significant. However, I did have some developmental difficulties later in childhood."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. You mentioned having some developmental difficulties later in childhood. Can you tell me a bit more about what those were? For example, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids around your age?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Moving on, can you tell me a bit about your high school experience? What was your average mark, and did you have a favorite topic or class during that time?

User: "I had an excellent performance in high school. My average mark was quite high, but I don't recall the exact number. As for favorite topics or classes, I enjoyed various subjects, but if I had to choose one, it would be art and design-related classes. They sparked my interest in becoming an exhibition designer later on."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, moving on to further education after high school, did you pursue any studies or training? If yes, could you tell me where and what type of studies?
