Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to ask more about your extended family, if you're comfortable doing so. However, let's move on to another topic first.

User: "I have two siblings, an older brother named Michael who is 40 years old, and a younger sister named Sarah who is 35 years old. They were both born in West Cassandra, British Columbia, Canada, where I was also born. As for what they do for work, I'm not sure about Michael's current occupation, but Sarah works as a... um... I think she's a teacher or something."

Assistant: That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your high school experience? What was your average mark, and did you have a favorite topic or class during that time?

User: "I had an excellent experience in high school. My average mark was quite high, and I enjoyed learning various subjects. If I had to choose a favorite topic or class, I would say that it was art. I found solace in painting and drawing, which eventually led me to become interested in graphic design later on. It's funny because looking back, I realize how much those classes helped me develop my creativity and passion for art."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it's great to hear how your interest in art developed. Now, I'd like to talk about further education after high school. Did you pursue any higher studies or certifications? If so, where and what type of studies did you undertake?

User: "I didn't pursue any higher studies or certifications after high school. However, I did develop skills in graphic design through self-study and hands-on experience, which helped me transition into freelance work later on."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on to talk about your work history and relationships. Could you tell me a bit about your previous work experience? Have you had any jobs before this one?

User: "I have had previous work experience. I worked as an administrative assistant for about three years and later transitioned into freelance graphic design, which I did for several years until 2018."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me more about your companies and years of work? For example, what was the name of the company where you worked as an administrative assistant, and when did you start freelancing?

User: "I worked as an administrative assistant from 2009 to 2012, but unfortunately, I don't recall the specific company name. After that, I transitioned into freelance graphic design work, which I did until 2018."

User: "I enjoy various activities in my free time. Painting is one of my favorite hobbies; it helps me relax and express myself creatively. I also appreciate playing the guitar, as it provides an outlet for emotional expression. Additionally, writing poetry allows me to process my thoughts and emotions in a constructive manner."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your hobbies with me. It's great that you have such creative outlets. What do you usually do to relax on a stressful day?

User: "I usually try to engage in some form of creative expression to relax on a stressful day. Whether it's painting, playing guitar, or writing poetry, these activities help me unwind and calm down. Sometimes, I also practice meditation and yoga to center myself and reduce stress. I find that immersing myself in creative pursuits or mindfulness practices helps distract me from stressful thoughts and calm my mind."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your relaxation techniques with me; that's very helpful. Now, I'd like to move on to something else. Is there anything the doctor needs to know about you or your situation that we haven't discussed yet?

User: "Yes, there is something important that we haven't discussed yet. It's hard for me to bring up, but I've experienced past trauma, which has had a significant impact on my life. Additionally, I've struggled with substance abuse in the past. I think it's essential for the doctor to know about these aspects of my situation."
