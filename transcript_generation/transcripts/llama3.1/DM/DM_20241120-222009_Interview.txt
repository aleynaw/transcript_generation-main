User: "Actually, I think it's worth mentioning that I've had some struggles with anorexia in the past, which led to me being hospitalized for severe malnutrition and dehydration. Also, I've had a few head injuries and concussions over the years, which have caused some temporary issues with memory loss and dizziness. I'm not sure if these things are directly related to my current situation, but I thought it was worth mentioning in case they're relevant to my treatment or care."
