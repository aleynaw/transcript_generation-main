User: "To be honest, I don't consume nicotine regularly, maybe only when I'm around others who are smoking. As for marijuana, I'd say I use it every 2-3 weeks, usually to help with relaxation and anxiety management. Regarding alcohol, I drink wine occasionally, perhaps once a week or every two weeks, usually in social settings. I'm still trying to manage my substance use, so these frequencies might vary depending on the situation and my mood."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your head injuries. Now, let's talk about seizures. Have you ever experienced any seizures or been diagnosed with a seizure disorder?

User: "I've experienced seizures before. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, but I think it happened around... actually, I'm not sure when exactly. It's hard for me to remember details about that time."

Note that in my response, I provided some additional context and emotions to simulate real-life variability and sensitivity around the topic.

Assistant: I understand that it can be difficult to remember specific details, especially when it's a sensitive topic. If you feel comfortable doing so, could you try to estimate roughly how long ago these seizures might have occurred? Was it within the past year, five years, or further back in your history?

User: "I'm not sure when exactly, but I think it might have been around... um... more than five years ago? Maybe even further back. To be honest, I don't really remember the details."

Assistant: That's okay if you're not sure about exact timing. Sometimes other events can help us piece together a timeline. Would you mind telling me a bit more about your siblings?

User: "I have one younger brother who is 27 years old. He lives in Toronto."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that about your brother. Now, could you tell me a bit more about where you were born?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Since you were born in Canada, I'd like to confirm whether you have Canadian citizenship. Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: No, I am not a Canadian citizen.

Despite the good grades, I did struggle with social interactions and following instructions at times."
