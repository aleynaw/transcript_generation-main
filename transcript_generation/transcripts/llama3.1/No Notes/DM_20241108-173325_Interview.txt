Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand it can be difficult to recall specific details about seizures. If you're comfortable, could you tell me more about when your seizures started? For example, was it during childhood or later in life?

User: "I'm not sure when my seizures started, but I think it might be related to my bipolar disorder or the medications I'm taking. I've been experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder since my early 20s, so maybe the seizures started around that time as well.

User: "I think I grew up mostly in Richardmouth, but I'm not sure if my family moved around a lot when I was really young. I don't have any specific memories of moving to or from Richardmouth as a child."

Assistant: Could you tell me more about whether you moved to Richardmouth at some point during your childhood or if you grew up entirely in that city?

User: "I didn't actually finish high school; I dropped out. As a result, I don't have an average mark to report, and I also didn't really have the opportunity to develop a preference for any particular topic or class."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing this with me. I understand that not completing high school can be a challenging experience. Now, could you tell me about any further education or training you've pursued after high school?

Additionally, I've had mild concussions in the past, which might be relevant to my current situation. I also want to mention that I have a history of seizures and am currently being treated for bipolar I disorder, major depressive disorder, and bulimia. Furthermore, I'm allergic to nuts, opioid pain medications, and naproxen, which is crucial information for any treatment or medication plans."
