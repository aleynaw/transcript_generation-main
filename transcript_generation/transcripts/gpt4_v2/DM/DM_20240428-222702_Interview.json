It\u2019s therapeutic, helps me process stuff.\n\nI also like hiking, being out in nature. British Columbia\u2019s got some amazing places to explore, and it\u2019s nice to just be out there, away from everything else. Clears the head, you know? And then there\u2019s music \u2013 listening, not playing. Wish I could play an instrument, but never really got around to learning. Music\u2019s another escape, a way to feel things deeply or just tune out the world for a bit.\n\nSo yeah, reading, writing, hiking, and music. Keeps me somewhat sane, gives me something to do with all the thoughts running around in my head."

It's great that you've found activities that help you stay grounded and process your thoughts. What do you do to relax on a stressful day?"

Or I\u2019ll go for a long hike if the weather\u2019s good, try to clear my head with some fresh air and nature. Writing\u2019s good for those really rough days, too, when my head\u2019s just full of stuff I can\u2019t seem to shake. Putting it all down on paper, it\u2019s like letting some of the pressure out, you know?\n\nMusic\u2019s a big one as well. I\u2019ll put on some headphones, blast my favorite tunes, and just zone out. Sometimes it\u2019s the only thing that can really calm me down, make me feel a bit more centered.\n\nAnd if all else fails, I just try to remind myself that it\u2019s okay to have bad days, that they pass. Might watch some mindless TV or cook something, just to keep my hands busy. It\u2019s all about finding those little things that help, even if it\u2019s just for a moment."

Using your hobbies and interests as a way to cope and center yourself is a healthy approach. Remembering that bad days pass is an important perspective to hold onto. \n\nIs there anything else you think the doctor should know about you or your situation that we haven't covered yet?"

        "content": "I guess the main thing is just that I\u2019ve been struggling a lot, more than I usually let on. It\u2019s like, I try to keep all these plates spinning \u2013 the bulimia, dealing with my mood, trying to stay sober, managing the seizures \u2013 and it just feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before they all come crashing down. I\u2019ve got this resistance to doctors because it feels like I\u2019ve been through it all before, and nothing really changes. But deep down, I know I need help, I just don\u2019t know how to make it stick, you know?\n\nAnd there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s scared of getting better because I don\u2019t really know who I am without all this stuff. It\u2019s been my identity for so long, the sick guy, the one who\u2019s always struggling. But I\u2019m tired, man. Really tired. I want to believe there\u2019s a way out, that things can get better. I just don\u2019t know how to get there.\n\nSo yeah, that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. Just a lot of confusion, fear, and a tiny bit of hope that maybe this time will be different. Maybe Dr. Waters can see something others haven\u2019t, or maybe I\u2019m just more ready to hear it now. Either way, I\u2019m here, giving it another shot. That\u2019s got to count for something, right?"

The fact that you're here, willing to give this another shot despite your past experiences and fears, speaks volumes about your strength and resilience. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the challenges you're facing and to have mixed feelings about getting better. Your honesty and self-awareness are crucial steps towards healing. Dr. Waters will appreciate knowing where you're at mentally and emotionally, and this insight will be invaluable in working together to find a path forward that feels right for you. Your openness to trying again, to seeking help, and to holding onto that bit of hope is a powerful foundation to build upon. Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. \n\nIf there's nothing more you wish to add, I believe we have covered all the necessary ground for now. Your courage and willingness to seek help are commendable, and I wish you the best in your journey ahead with Dr. Waters. Remember, you're not alone in this, and taking it one step at a time is okay. \n\nThank you, and goodbye."
