Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Denise Fields’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on October 16 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Denise Fields to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, sure, I guess that's okay. Just don't expect me to spill all my guts, alright? Docs haven't been much help before, so let's see how this goes.

Assistant: I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to participate. We'll go through the questions at a pace that's comfortable for you, and you're welcome to share as much as you feel comfortable with. Let's start with some general information. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: It's Danielle Jodi Bolton.

Assistant: Thank you, Danielle. Do you have a preferred name or nickname you'd like us to use?

User: Just Danielle is fine.

Assistant: Great, Danielle. Could you please tell me your date of birth?

User: November 20, 1980.

Assistant: Thank you. What is your sex?

User: Female.

Assistant: Got it. Can you tell me your current city or town of residence?

User: I'm living in South Juan, British Columbia.

Assistant: Thank you, Danielle. Are you currently single, married, or in a common-law relationship?

User: I'm in a long-term relationship.

Assistant: Understood. Do you have any children or dependents?

User: No, none.

Assistant: Alright. Are you currently working? If yes, could you please provide the name of the company and how many years you've been working there?

User: Yeah, I work as a sales promotion account executive. Been at it for about 7 years now.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Are you currently receiving any form of disability assistance?

User: No, I'm not.

Assistant: Understood. What about your handedness – are you left-handed, right-handed, or do you use both hands equally?

User: I'm right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you. Could you tell me about any current doctors you are seeing?

User: Honestly, it's just been a cycle of seeing different ones without much sticking. But right now, nobody specific, just the appointment with Dr. Fields coming up.

Assistant: I see, thank you for sharing that. Do you have any known allergies?

User: Yeah, pet dander, penicillin, and ibuprofen.

Assistant: Noted. Are you currently taking any medications, and if so, could you please share the names and dosages?

User: I'm on Sertraline, but I'd rather not get into the dosage right now.

Assistant: That's completely okay, Danielle. We can leave the specifics for your discussion with Dr. Fields. How about health supplements? Are you taking any?

User: No, no supplements.

Assistant: Understood. Can you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use?

User: Don't use any of that stuff. Never really saw the point.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions, and if so, could you share the details such as when you were diagnosed?

User: I've got this thing where I can't stop eating sometimes. It's like, no matter how full I am, I just keep going. Been dealing with it for a while, but I don't remember exactly when it started. And yeah, I've had some issues with seizures and stuff since I was younger. Plus, school was always a struggle, felt like my brain just didn't work like everyone else's.

Assistant: I appreciate your openness, Danielle. It sounds like you've been managing a lot. For the eating issue, has it ever been formally diagnosed by a healthcare professional, such as binge eating disorder or something similar?

And regarding the seizures, could you share more about when they started and if you've received any specific diagnosis or treatment for them?

User: Yeah, the eating thing was tagged as binge eating disorder a bit back. As for the seizures, they've been around since I was a kid. I don't dive much into specifics, to be honest. Just know they happen and I've been dealing with them, but no special treatment or anything.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that, Danielle. It's important to have this information, and Dr. Fields will likely want to explore these areas further with you. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that we should be aware of?

User: Nope, no hospital stays or surgeries. Just the usual doctor visits that don't seem to lead anywhere.

Assistant: Understood, Danielle. It can be frustrating when it feels like you're not making progress. Regarding your history of head injuries or concussions, have you experienced any incidents like these? If yes, could you share when and how they happened?

User: No head injuries or concussions here. Been lucky in that department, I guess.

Assistant: That's good to hear. Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling?

User: No, never needed rehab or counseling for substances. Never been my issue.

Assistant: Thank you for clarifying. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health concerns? If yes, could you share who, when, and why?

User: Not really, just the odd visit to whoever was available when I felt like I couldn't manage on my own. No one consistent. It's been a mix of trying to find someone who gets it, but no luck so far.

Assistant: I understand how challenging that can be, to find the right support. Let's talk a bit about your family history now. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: Family stuff is complicated. There might be some history there, but we don't talk about it much. I know a cousin had some issues, but not sure about the details or if they got treatment. We're not really the type to share much about personal problems.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you can, Danielle. It's not uncommon for families to keep health matters private. What about a family history of neurological or genetic conditions? Is there anything like that in your family?

User: Not that I know of. If there is, it's not something we've talked about. Family health isn't a common topic at our gatherings.

Assistant: Understood, it's quite common for some families to keep health discussions to a minimum. Could you tell me about your siblings, if you have any? I'm interested in their basic info such as names, ages, where they live, and what they do for a living.

User: I'd rather not get into specifics about my siblings. Let's just say we're not super close and leave it at that.

Assistant: That's perfectly fine, Danielle. We'll respect your privacy on that matter. Let's move on to your personal history. Where were you born? If it was outside Canada, could you share the year of your arrival?

User: I was born right here in Canada, so no arrival story for me.

Assistant: Thank you, Danielle. Are you a Canadian citizen then?

User: Yes, Canadian citizen.

Assistant: Great, thank you. Were there any complications during your birth that you're aware of?

User: Not that I've been told. Seems like my birth was pretty standard, no big issues or anything.

Assistant: Good to know. When you were young, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age, or did you notice any differences?

User: I guess you could say things were a bit off. Walking and talking came late for me, and making friends wasn't exactly easy. School was always a struggle, felt like I was always trying to catch up to the other kids.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that, Danielle. It sounds like those early years were challenging. Moving on, did you encounter any difficulties in elementary school, either academically or socially?

User: Yeah, elementary school was tough. Academically, I was pretty poor, and socially, it wasn't much better. Always felt like I was on the outside looking in.

Assistant: It can be really tough feeling that way, especially during those formative years. Thank you for being open about your experiences. Have you had any traumatic experiences growing up that you feel comfortable sharing?

User: No, nothing like that. Just the usual ups and downs, but no big traumatic events.

Assistant: I'm glad to hear there were no major traumatic events. Could you tell me about your average mark and favorite topic or class in high school?

User: My marks were pretty average in high school. Managed to get by, you know? Didn't really have a favorite class. School was more about getting through it than enjoying any part of it.

Assistant: Understandable, it sounds like you focused on getting through school. After high school, did you pursue further education? If yes, where and what type of studies?

User: No, I didn't go for more schooling after high school. Jumped straight into work. Always felt more comfortable working than sitting in a classroom.

Assistant: That makes sense, and it's a path many choose and find fulfilling. Could you share a bit about your previous work history, such as companies you've worked for and years of work?

User: I've been in sales most of my career, different companies, mostly local ones here in British Columbia. Started out in retail sales right after high school, then moved into sales promotions. Been with my current company for the last 7 years. Before that, it was a mix of jobs, nothing really worth noting.

Assistant: It sounds like you've built a solid career in sales, Danielle. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships before your current one?

User: No previous marriages, but yeah, there's been a couple of long-term relationships before this one. Nothing that stuck, obviously.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. It's all part of life's journey. What are some hobbies or activities you enjoy?

User: Not much of a hobby person, really. I guess you could say I enjoy watching movies and the occasional walk. Keeps things simple.

Assistant: Movies and walks can be a great way to relax and unwind. Speaking of which, what do you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: On a stressful day, I might just zone out in front of the TV or go for a long drive if the weather's nice. Helps clear my head a bit.

Assistant: It sounds like you have some good strategies for managing stress. Before we conclude, is there anything else you believe the doctor needs to know that we haven't covered yet?

User: I think that's pretty much it. Just... I guess, just hoping this time around, talking to a doc might actually lead somewhere, you know? But we'll see.

Assistant: I understand, Danielle. It's completely valid to have that hope and also some apprehension based on past experiences. Your feelings are important, and sharing them here is a step toward finding the support you're looking for. Dr. Fields will have this information to help make your appointment as productive as possible. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today, and please take care. Goodbye.
