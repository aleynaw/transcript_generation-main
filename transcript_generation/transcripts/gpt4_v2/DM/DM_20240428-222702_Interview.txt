Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Jon Waters’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on February 15 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Jon Waters to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Hey, yeah, I guess it's fine. Don't really see how it helps, talking never did much for me before, but let’s give it a shot, right? Docs always seem to think they’ve got the magic answer, but it’s all been a bunch of circles for me so far. Anyway, shoot your questions or whatever you need to know.

Assistant: I understand your concerns and appreciate your willingness to participate in this process. Let's begin with some general information. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: Yeah, sure, it's Jose John Anderson. That's me, though I don't really see how my name's gonna change much. But there you go.

Assistant: Thank you, Jose. Do you have a preferred name you'd like us to use during our interactions and in your records?

User: Nah, Jose’s fine. It’s what everyone calls me anyway. Makes things simpler, I guess.

Assistant: Got it, Jose. Could you please provide your date of birth?

User: Oh, yeah, it’s August 31, 2002. Feels weird thinking about it, like, I'm 21 but sometimes it feels like I've been around way longer with all the stuff that's gone down, you know?

Assistant: I hear you, Jose. It can indeed feel overwhelming at times. Now, could you tell me your sex?

User: I'm a dude, male. Not sure how that plays into everything, but there it is.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing, Jose. What is your current city or town of residence?

User: I'm living in Robertberg, British Columbia. Got a small place at 5476 Wesley Underpass, Apt. 460. It’s alright, keeps me somewhat grounded, I guess.

Assistant: It's good to have a place that feels somewhat grounding. Could you tell me if you are single, married, or in a common-law relationship?

User: Single. Haven’t really had much luck or energy for that kind of thing, you know? Relationships seem like a lot when you’re just trying to keep your own head above water.

Assistant: I understand, maintaining personal well-being takes precedence. Do you have any children or dependents?

User: No, no kids. Just me. Can barely take care of myself most days, wouldn't be fair to have someone else depending on me.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that, Jose. It's important to recognize what you can handle. Are you currently working? If yes, could you tell me the name of the company and how many years you've been working there?

User: Yeah, sort of. I'm a student TEFL teacher, teaching English to folks online. It’s not really a company thing, more freelance. Been doing it for a bit now, helps to have something flexible, you know? Gives me a bit of structure without being too overwhelming.

Assistant: That sounds like a good fit for maintaining flexibility while having some structure. Since it's freelance, we can skip the company name. How about disability assistance? Are you currently receiving any form of disability assistance? If yes, could you specify the type and when it started?

User: Yeah, I get some disability assistance. Started a while back, after things got real bad and I couldn't keep up with... well, life, I guess. It’s for my mental stuff and the seizures I’ve had. Not exactly proud of needing it, but it’s been a lifeline, keeps me afloat when I'm sinking.

Assistant: It's important to have support that helps you manage, and there's no shame in utilizing resources designed for that purpose. Could you tell me about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or do you use both hands equally?

User: Oh, I'm right-handed. Always have been. Not much of a story there, just your regular right-handed guy trying to scribble down notes and stuff.

Assistant: Noted, Jose. Being right-handed is quite common. Now, could you tell me about any current doctors you are seeing for your health?

User: Not really seeing anyone regularly. I mean, I've been to docs before, had my rounds with therapists and whatnot, but nothing stuck. Feels like they don’t really get it, or maybe I don’t get them. It’s like we’re speaking different languages. So, no, no one specific I'm seeing right now. Just kinda floating, trying to manage on my own.

Assistant: I understand that finding the right healthcare professional who you feel truly understands you can be challenging. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies?

User: Nope, no allergies that I know of. At least that’s one less thing to worry about, right? Life’s complicated enough without having to dodge peanuts or whatever.

Assistant: Definitely, it's good to have one less thing to manage. Could you tell me about any current medications and their dosages that you are taking?

User: Oh, yeah, I’m on this med for my mood, called Fluxetine or something. I'm terrible with names. The dosage... I think it’s like 20 mg? Yeah, that sounds about right. Not sure it’s doing much, but they tell me it’s supposed to help.

Assistant: Fluoxetine, understood. It's quite common for managing mood. Are you taking any health supplements?

User: Nah, no supplements. Just the Fluxetine. Sometimes I think maybe I should, like maybe there’s some magic pill out there that could make all the difference. But then I remember how the actual meds are supposed to be that magic pill, and well, here we are.

Assistant: It's understandable to have those thoughts, especially when navigating through treatment options. Let's move on to lifestyle habits. Could you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, and alcohol use?

User: Ah, well, that's a bit of a mixed bag. I've dabbled in a bit of everything, to be honest. Smoked a fair bit, both cigs and weed. Alcohol, too. It’s like, sometimes it feels like they help, you know? Give me a break from my own head. But then sometimes, it's just another thing that messes me up more. Hard to find a balance. Been trying to cut back, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster.

Assistant: I appreciate your honesty, Jose. Finding a balance can indeed be challenging. Let's pivot to your medical history. Could you share any health conditions or diagnoses you have received, including details such as when you were diagnosed?

User: Yeah, sure. So, I’ve got bulimia. Been dealing with it for a few years now. It’s like this never-ending cycle, you know? Also, had my fair share of seizures, which freaked me out the first few times. Got diagnosed with the bulimia thing back when I was around 17, after dropping out of high school. The seizures started around then too, but they couldn’t pin down why exactly. Just another thing on the list, I guess. And then there’s the mental rollercoaster, which they slapped the label of depression on, hence the Fluxetine. It’s been a ride, man.

Assistant: It sounds like you've been navigating through quite a bit, Jose. Your resilience in facing these challenges is notable. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?

User: Yeah, had a couple of stints in the hospital. Once was after a particularly bad seizure, and they wanted to keep an eye on me, run some tests and stuff. Then there was the time things got really dark, and I ended up there because of my bulimia... and well, trying to hurt myself. No surgeries, though, just a lot of monitoring, talking, and trying different meds. Feels like I’ve spent half my life in and out of those places.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you've had to go through all of that, Jose. It's important to have support during such times. Regarding your history of head injuries or concussions, have you experienced any? If yes, could you share when and how it happened?

User: No, nothing like that. No head injuries or concussions. I guess I’ve been lucky in that sense. Most of my stuff is more... inside, I guess. Mental and emotional, not so much the physical injuries.

Assistant: It's a relief to hear you haven't had to deal with head injuries or concussions on top of everything else. Have you ever had a history of seizures that you mentioned earlier? Could you share more about when they started and any details surrounding them?

User: Yeah, the seizures started a few years back, around the same time all the other stuff was getting bad, like when I was 17. It was scary, man. One minute you're fine, next thing you know, you’re waking up on the floor with people freaking out around you. They did a bunch of tests, but they never really figured out why they were happening. Just one of those things, I guess. Had to be careful, watch for triggers, but it’s not like there’s a manual for this stuff. It’s been a bit since the last one, thankfully. Trying to keep it that way.

Assistant: It sounds incredibly challenging to navigate, especially with the unpredictability of seizures. I'm glad to hear it's been a bit since the last one. Have you ever undergone rehab or substance counseling for your nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use? If yes, could you share where and when?

User: Nah, never went to rehab or anything formal like that for the smoking, weed, or drinking. Thought about it a few times, especially when things seemed really out of control. But I always kinda just tried to manage it on my own, you know? Sometimes I’d cut back, try to get a handle on it, but it’s tough. It’s like, those things become your crutches, and even when you know they’re bad for you, it’s hard to let go. So, no, no rehab or counseling specifically for substance stuff. Just me trying to figure it out, bit by bit.

Assistant: It's understandable how challenging it can be to manage on your own, especially when substances become a coping mechanism. Your efforts to manage and reflect on your use are important steps. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health concerns? If yes, could you share who, when, and why?

User: Yeah, I’ve seen a few over the years. Different therapists and counselors, mainly for the bulimia and the whole mental health rollercoaster. And then there were the neurologists for the seizures. This was all scattered over the last few years, especially heavy around when I was 17 and just after. Each time, it was like trying to find something, anything, that would click and make a difference. But it always felt like we were speaking different languages, or like they were missing the point. It’s hard to keep track of all the names and places, feels like a blur sometimes. Just a lot of trying and not a lot of getting anywhere, you know?

Assistant: It sounds like you've been through quite a journey trying to find the right support and treatment. It can be frustrating when it feels like you're not making progress despite your efforts. Let's shift to your family history. Could you share if there's a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: Yeah, there’s some of that in the family. My mom’s side, especially. She’s had her own battles with depression, been on and off meds for as long as I can remember. And I think her sister, my aunt, had some serious anxiety stuff going on. They both saw therapists at different points, I think. My mom was in the hospital a couple of times when I was really young, but it’s not something we talk about much. It’s like this shadow that’s always been there, you know? Makes you wonder how much of this stuff is just passed down, waiting for you to pick up where they left off.

Assistant: It's insightful of you to recognize the impact of family history on personal health. It can indeed feel like a shadow, but understanding these patterns can also be a step toward seeking the right kind of help and support. Do you know if there's a family history of neurological or genetic conditions? If yes, who and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: Not much that I know of on the neurological or genetic front. If there is, it’s not something that’s been talked about much in the family. Seems like the focus has always been more on the mental health side of things. No stories of seizures or anything like that in the family, as far as I’m aware. It’s like I hit some kind of weird genetic lottery with that one. So, no, nothing I can really point to there, just the mental health battles that seem to run in the family.

Assistant: It's helpful to have that context, even if the focus has primarily been on mental health within your family. Understanding the broader health history can sometimes offer insights into personal health challenges. Do you have any siblings? If yes, could you share each sibling's basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation?

User: No, no siblings. It’s just been me. Sometimes wonder if having a brother or sister would’ve made things different, you know? Like, would I have someone to talk to who really gets it because they’re going through it too? Or would it just be another person to worry about? Guess it’s one of those things I’ll never know. Just me trying to navigate this stuff on my own.

Assistant: Being an only child does indeed shape your experiences and perspectives in unique ways, including how you navigate challenges. It's natural to wonder about these what-ifs. Let's move on to your personal history. Where were you born? If you were born outside of Canada, could you share the year of your arrival?

User: I was born right here in Canada, so no dramatic arrival story or anything like that. Been in British Columbia all my life. It’s funny, sometimes it feels like you can be from a place, know it inside out, but still feel like you don’t quite fit, you know? But yeah, Canadian through and through, from the start.

Assistant: It's interesting how one can feel both connected to and detached from their place of birth. Being a lifelong resident of British Columbia must have its own set of unique experiences. Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: Yeah, I'm a Canadian citizen. Born and raised, like I said. It’s got its good points, but sometimes I wonder what life would be like somewhere else. Not that I’m planning on going anywhere. Just, you know, late-night thoughts.

Assistant: It's natural to have those late-night thoughts and wonder about different paths and places. Let's talk a bit about your early life. Were there any birth complications that you're aware of?

User: Not that I’ve ever been told about. As far as I know, it was all pretty standard, no big dramas. My mom never mentioned anything out of the ordinary, just the usual stories of how happy they were, all that stuff. So, yeah, nothing noteworthy on the birth complications front.

Assistant: It's good to hear there were no complications at your birth. In your early years, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age?

User: Yeah, pretty much. I was walking and talking at the usual times, I guess. Had a few friends, did the normal kid stuff, playing outside, getting into minor trouble, all that. Never felt like I was behind or anything in those early days. It was all pretty standard, nothing that stood out as weird or different. Life was simpler back then, you know?

Assistant: It's nice to have those simple and carefree memories from childhood. Did you face any difficulties during your elementary school years?

User: Nah, elementary school was alright for the most part. I was a decent student, got along okay with the other kids. Had my share of good times, nothing too heavy. It was later that things started getting complicated, but back in those days, it was mostly just normal kid stuff. Wish it could’ve stayed that simple, to be honest.

Assistant: It's understandable to look back fondly on simpler times. As you mentioned things got more complicated later, could you share any traumatic experiences you had growing up?

User: Well, it’s kinda hard to dive into, you know? There’s been stuff. Like, the family’s always been a bit of a mess, under the surface. My mom’s depression, that was a big shadow over everything. Made things feel unstable a lot of the time. And then there was just... I dunno, a lot of pressure, I guess. Pressure to be okay, to do well, to not add to the problems. Ended up dropping out of high school because it all just got too much. And there’s been other stuff, darker moments, hard to talk about. Just a lot of things that pile up, make you feel like you’re trapped in a tunnel with no light, you know?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jose. It takes courage to open up about these experiences, and it's important to acknowledge the impact they have on you. Let's shift to a lighter topic for a moment. What was your average mark and favorite topic or class in high school?

User: Ah, high school... Feels like a lifetime ago. My marks were alright, I guess, mostly Bs and some Cs. Nothing spectacular, but I was getting by. Favorite class? Probably English. I liked the stories, the way you could dive into different worlds, different lives. It was an escape, you know? Made me think maybe I could do something with words, hence the whole TEFL thing later on. It’s funny how those little bits stick with you, even when the rest feels like a blur.

Assistant: It's fascinating how certain subjects can resonate with us and even influence our paths later in life. Your connection to English and storytelling is a beautiful example of finding solace and inspiration in education. Did you pursue further education after high school? If yes, where and what type of studies?

User: Nah, after dropping out, I didn’t go back to the traditional education route. Just felt like it wasn’t for me, you know? But I didn’t give up on learning altogether. Ended up getting into the TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) stuff online. Took some courses, got certified. It’s not college or anything, but it felt right. Like I was building something for myself, in my own way. Teaching has been good for me, gives me a sense of purpose, and I get to use my love for English to help others. It’s one of the few things that feels like it fits.

Assistant: It's inspiring to hear how you've carved out a path that feels right for you, using your strengths and passions to make a positive impact on others. Finding purpose and fulfillment in what we do is incredibly important. Could you share a bit about your previous work history? Have you worked at any companies before, and if so, which ones and for how many years?

User: Before I got into the whole TEFL thing, I didn’t really have much of a "traditional" work history. Did some odd jobs here and there, you know, the usual stuff young people do to make a bit of cash. Worked a bit in retail, a local grocery store, and did some delivery stuff for a while. Nothing that lasted too long or felt like it was going anywhere. Just bits and pieces to get by and figure stuff out. It was all before I found teaching English online, which, honestly, has been the first thing that’s felt like a real job to me. Something I actually care about and want to stick with. So, no big companies or long-term positions, just a lot of hopping around until I landed on something good.

Assistant: It sounds like you've explored various roles before finding something that truly resonates with you. That journey of discovery is valuable, offering diverse experiences and insights. Let's talk about relationships for a moment. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: No, nothing like that. Been single most of the time. Had a few short-term things, but nothing that ever really stuck or felt serious. It’s been tough, you know, with all the stuff going on with me. Makes it hard to let people in, or to even want to sometimes. Feels like a lot to ask of someone, to deal with all my baggage. So yeah, no marriages or long-term relationships. Just me, trying to figure out my own path without dragging anyone else into the mess.

Assistant: It's understandable to feel cautious about entering relationships when dealing with personal challenges. Taking time for yourself and focusing on your path is important. Let's shift to a lighter topic. What are some of your hobbies?

User: Hobbies, huh? I guess I’ve got a few things that keep me grounded. Reading’s always been big for me, like I mentioned with English class. Losing myself in a book, it’s one of the best escapes. And I’ve gotten into writing a bit, too. Nothing major, just jotting down thoughts, stories, sometimes poetry if the mood strikes. It’s therapeutic, helps me process stuff.

I also like hiking, being out in nature. British Columbia’s got some amazing places to explore, and it’s nice to just be out there, away from everything else. Clears the head, you know? And then there’s music – listening, not playing. Wish I could play an instrument, but never really got around to learning. Music’s another escape, a way to feel things deeply or just tune out the world for a bit.

So yeah, reading, writing, hiking, and music. Keeps me somewhat sane, gives me something to do with all the thoughts running around in my head.

Assistant: Your hobbies sound like wonderful ways to find peace and express yourself, Jose. Reading, writing, hiking, and music can all be incredibly therapeutic and enriching experiences. It's great that you've found activities that help you stay grounded and process your thoughts. What do you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: On a stressful day, I kinda lean into those hobbies more. I might pick up a book and read for hours, just to get lost in a different world. Or I’ll go for a long hike if the weather’s good, try to clear my head with some fresh air and nature. Writing’s good for those really rough days, too, when my head’s just full of stuff I can’t seem to shake. Putting it all down on paper, it’s like letting some of the pressure out, you know?

Music’s a big one as well. I’ll put on some headphones, blast my favorite tunes, and just zone out. Sometimes it’s the only thing that can really calm me down, make me feel a bit more centered.

And if all else fails, I just try to remind myself that it’s okay to have bad days, that they pass. Might watch some mindless TV or cook something, just to keep my hands busy. It’s all about finding those little things that help, even if it’s just for a moment.

Assistant: It sounds like you have a solid set of strategies for managing stress and finding moments of calm. Using your hobbies and interests as a way to cope and center yourself is a healthy approach. Remembering that bad days pass is an important perspective to hold onto. 

Is there anything else you think the doctor should know about you or your situation that we haven't covered yet?

User: I guess the main thing is just that I’ve been struggling a lot, more than I usually let on. It’s like, I try to keep all these plates spinning – the bulimia, dealing with my mood, trying to stay sober, managing the seizures – and it just feels like it’s only a matter of time before they all come crashing down. I’ve got this resistance to doctors because it feels like I’ve been through it all before, and nothing really changes. But deep down, I know I need help, I just don’t know how to make it stick, you know?

And there’s a part of me that’s scared of getting better because I don’t really know who I am without all this stuff. It’s been my identity for so long, the sick guy, the one who’s always struggling. But I’m tired, man. Really tired. I want to believe there’s a way out, that things can get better. I just don’t know how to get there.

So yeah, that’s where I’m at. Just a lot of confusion, fear, and a tiny bit of hope that maybe this time will be different. Maybe Dr. Waters can see something others haven’t, or maybe I’m just more ready to hear it now. Either way, I’m here, giving it another shot. That’s got to count for something, right?

Assistant: Jose, it absolutely counts for a lot. The fact that you're here, willing to give this another shot despite your past experiences and fears, speaks volumes about your strength and resilience. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the challenges you're facing and to have mixed feelings about getting better. Your honesty and self-awareness are crucial steps towards healing. Dr. Waters will appreciate knowing where you're at mentally and emotionally, and this insight will be invaluable in working together to find a path forward that feels right for you. Your openness to trying again, to seeking help, and to holding onto that bit of hope is a powerful foundation to build upon. Thank you for sharing so openly with me today. 

If there's nothing more you wish to add, I believe we have covered all the necessary ground for now. Your courage and willingness to seek help are commendable, and I wish you the best in your journey ahead with Dr. Waters. Remember, you're not alone in this, and taking it one step at a time is okay. 

Thank you, and goodbye.
