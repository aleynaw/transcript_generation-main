Feels like I've been through the wringer with docs, no offense. It's like, how many times can you go over the same ground without finding anything new?\n\nLife's been... well, it's been a rollercoaster, you know? Ever since my partner passed, it's like I'm stuck in this weird fog. Can't seem to shake it off. And then there's the whole thing with my head being all over the place. One minute I'm up, next I'm down. Makes focusing on my studies a real challenge. Physics is tough enough without your brain going on a vacation every other minute.\n\nBeen trying to stick to the meds, Paxil and Olanzapine, but it's like a band-aid on a bullet wound sometimes. Plus, the whole PTSD and BPD cocktail, it's a lot. Makes you feel broken in ways you can't even explain. And I've got this thing about doctors... I know they're trying to help, but it feels like they don't get it. Like they're just throwing pills at a problem they can't see.\n\nAnyway, I'm rambling. What do you need to know?"

Like, if the weather's clear, I might spend some time with my telescope, just me and the stars. It's a reminder of the bigger picture, helps put things in perspective. Or I'll lose myself in music, let it wash over me and carry some of the stress away. There's something about music that can reach parts of you words can't touch.\n\nAnd then, sometimes, it's as simple as just stepping outside, taking a walk. Fresh air, a change of scenery, can make a bit of a difference. Helps to clear my head, even if it's just for a little while. It's these little things, you know? They don't solve everything, but they give me a bit of a breather, a chance to gather myself before diving back in.\n\nSo, yeah, that's pretty much it. Stargazing, music, and walks. Simple, but they're my go-to methods for trying to find some calm in the chaos."

But it feels like it might be helpful, having someone else understand where I'm coming from before walking into another appointment. \n\nI guess if there's anything else for Dr. Scott to know, it's just that I'm trying, you know? Some days are better than others. Some days it feels like I'm backsliding, but I'm trying to keep moving forward, even when it feels like I'm walking against the wind. \n\nAnd, I don't know, maybe just that I hope this can be different. That maybe this time, something clicks, something actually helps in a more lasting way. I know there's no magic fix, but a bit of hope goes a long way.\n\nAnyway, thanks again. It's been... cathartic, in a way, to lay it all out like this. See you at the appointment, I guess."
