Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Michael Tranâ€™s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on February 28 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Michael Tran to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Oh, hello there. Yeah, sure, I guess we can talk a bit. I'm not too sure what good it'll do, talking to doctors hasn't really been my cup of tea, you know? They seem to just nod and scribble stuff down, but alright, let's give this a shot. What do you wanna know?

Assistant: Thank you for being open to this process. Let's start with some general information. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: Yeah, it's Rebecca Jillian Smith. That's the name they've got on all the forms and stuff, so that's me.

Assistant: Thank you, Rebecca. Do you have a preferred name you'd like us to use, or is Rebecca fine?

User: Rebecca's fine, I guess. No one really bothers with nicknames or anything for me. Just Rebecca.

Assistant: Got it, Rebecca. Could you please share your date of birth with me?

User: Sure, it's November 24, 1962. Makes me a Sagittarius, not that I put much stock in all that star stuff. My life's been more about dealing with the here and now, you know?

Assistant: I understand, focusing on the present is important. Could you tell me your sex?

User: I'm female. Been dealing with all that comes with that for 61 years now.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing, Rebecca. What is your current city or town of residence?

User: I'm living in Acostatown, British Columbia. Got a little place at 898 Anderson Isle Suite 649. It's quiet, I guess. Keeps me out of trouble, or that's the idea anyway.

Assistant: It's good to have a quiet place. Could you tell me about your current marital status? Are you single, married, or in a common law relationship?

User: I'm in something casual, not really tied down. It's complicated, you know? Never been much for labels or making things official. Life's too messy for that.

Assistant: I understand, life can indeed be complex. Do you have any children or dependents?

User: Yeah, I've got kids. They're all grown up now, doing their own thing. It's just me most of the time these days. They come around or call when they can, you know how it is. Life gets busy.

Assistant: It sounds like you've raised independent children. Could you share their names and ages?

User: Oh, you know, I'd rather not drag them into all this. They've got their lives, and I've got my... stuff. Let's just say they're adults and leave it at that, alright? They don't need their names in some doctor's notes.

Assistant: Of course, we can respect their privacy. Moving on, are you currently working?

User: Nope, not working. Been unemployed for a bit now. It's tough out there, and with my own... issues, it's been hard to hold anything down. Plus, who's gonna hire someone my age with my kind of history, right?

Assistant: I understand how challenging that can be. Have you applied for or are receiving any form of disability assistance?

User: Nah, I haven't gone down that road yet. It's all a big mess of paperwork and hoops to jump through. Feels like they make it complicated on purpose, you know? Plus, I've got a bit of a stubborn streak. Been trying to manage on my own, for better or worse.

Assistant: It's understandable wanting to manage independently. Can you tell me about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous?

User: I'm right-handed. Always have been. It's the one thing that's been straightforward about me, I guess.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me about your current doctors? Do you have any specialists or general practitioners you see regularly?

User: Doctors, huh? Well, I've seen a few over the years, but it's like I said, never felt like they really got what was going on with me. I've got Dr. Michael Tran, obviously, since you're asking for him. But regularly? Nah, I don't do regular check-ups or anything. Just when things get too much to handle on my own, I guess.

Assistant: I see, it's important to have someone to turn to when needed. Do you have any known allergies?

User: Yeah, a few actually. Opioid pain meds, latex, and fragrances. Makes it a bit tricky with hospitals and doctors' offices, you know? Always have to be on guard with that stuff.

Assistant: It's good to be aware of those allergies for your safety. Could you tell me about any current medications and their dosages that you're taking?

User: Oh, right. I'm on Zolof for my mood, you know? Helps a bit, I suppose. Keeps the edges from getting too sharp. But the dosage and all that, I'd have to check the bottle. I'm not great with numbers and details like that.

Assistant: That's perfectly understandable. If you could check the bottle when you have a moment and let us know the dosage, that would be helpful. In the meantime, are you taking any health supplements?

User: No, no supplements. Just the Zoloft. I've heard all sorts of things about vitamins and whatnot, but never got into it. Seems like another thing to keep track of, and I've got enough on my plate as it is.

Assistant: Understood, keeping things simple can definitely help manage everything. Could you share your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use?

User: Well, I've had my rounds with all that. Used to smoke, but I gave it up. Alcohol, it's here and there. Not much of a drinker these days. Marijuana, well, it's legal here, isn't it? Might partake occasionally, helps take the edge off, but it's not a daily thing. And then there's the other stuff, but that's all in the past now. Been trying to keep clean, you know?

Assistant: It's commendable that you're making efforts to keep clean and manage your health. Let's move on to your medical history. Could you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you have received, including details such as when you were diagnosed?

User: Oh, where do I start? I've got this binge-eating thing. Been dealing with it for years, but got officially slapped with that label a while back. Can't remember exactly when. It's like, sometimes food's the only thing that makes sense, you know? Then there's the seizures. Had a few of those scary moments. They say it's under control, but it feels like a ticking time bomb sometimes. And well, there's the mood stuff, hence the Zoloft. Been on and off things for that for years. Plus, all the stuff life's thrown my way, it's a wonder I'm still kicking. Substance issues, too, but like I said, trying to keep that in the rearview. And yeah, developmental stuff from way back when, but who's counting anymore?

Assistant: It sounds like you've been through quite a lot, Rebecca. Your resilience is truly notable. Regarding the seizures, could you share more about when they started and how they've been managed?

User: The seizures, yeah, they started a good while back. I'd say it's been a decade or so? It's all a bit fuzzy. They had me on some meds for it at one point, but it's been a bit of a balancing act, what with everything else going on. Mostly, it's just been about trying to avoid triggers, you know? Stress, lack of sleep, that sort of thing. But it's not like you can just put life on pause. Managed, I guess, but it's always there in the back of my mind.

Assistant: Managing triggers is an important part of dealing with seizures. It's understandable that it feels like a constant concern. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that we should be aware of?

User: Hospitalizations, yeah, a few. Mostly related to the seizures or when things got really bad with my eating. No surgeries, though. It's mostly been about trying to manage things with medication and what they call "lifestyle changes." Feels like I've spent enough time in hospitals to last a lifetime. Always a bit nerve-wracking, what with my allergies and all. But no surgeries, no. Just lots of tests, talks, and too many waiting rooms.

Assistant: It's clear you've had to navigate some challenging experiences with your health. Let's talk about your history of head injuries or concussions. Have you experienced any, and if so, could you share when and how they occurred?

User: Head injuries, huh? Well, I've had a couple of knocks here and there. Nothing too serious, I guess. Had a fall a few years back, slipped on some ice. Ended up with a bit of a concussion, had a headache for days. Then there was another time, way back, can't even remember how it happened. Just know I ended up in the ER with a pretty bad headache. They did scans and all that, said I was fine, but it shook me up pretty good. Haven't had anything like that recently, thankfully. Life's rough enough without adding brain injuries to the mix.

Assistant: I'm glad to hear there haven't been any recent incidents. It's important to take care of yourself, especially after experiences like those. Have you had a history of seizures, and if so, when did they start?

User: Yeah, like I mentioned before, the seizures started about a decade ago. It's been a bit of a journey, dealing with them. They kind of came out of nowhere, scared me and everyone else pretty good. Been trying to manage them ever since, with the meds and avoiding triggers. It's a bit of a tightrope walk, you know? Always having to be careful, but that's just how it is.

Assistant: Thank you for reiterating that, Rebecca. It's indeed a careful balance managing seizures. Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling, and if so, where and when?

User: Yeah, I've been through the whole rehab thing a couple of times. Substance counseling, too. It's all part of trying to get a handle on things, you know? The first time was quite a few years back, can't remember exactly when. Then again, more recently. It's tough, facing all that. But I guess it's part of trying to do better, trying to be better. It's not easy, talking about all this stuff, digging up the past. But I guess it's supposed to help, right? Just feels like a lot sometimes.

Assistant: It's incredibly brave of you to confront these challenges and seek help to improve your situation. It's a significant step towards healing and growth, even though it can feel overwhelming at times. Have you consulted any other medical professionals for your health concerns, and if so, could you share who, when, and why?

User: Oh, I've seen a few over the years. Different doctors for different things. There was a nutritionist for the binge-eating, that was a couple of years ago. Tried to help me get my eating habits in order, you know? Then there's been a few different therapists and counselors for the mood stuff and the substance issues. And the neurologist for the seizures, of course. It's been a bit of a revolving door, seeing all these specialists. Sometimes it feels like they're just throwing solutions at the wall to see what sticks. Can't say I remember all their names or the exact dates. It's all a blur of appointments and advice. Some of it helps, some of it doesn't. Just trying to keep moving forward, I guess.

Assistant: Your journey through various treatments and consultations shows a lot of strength and persistence, Rebecca. It's understandable that remembering every detail can be challenging. Let's shift our focus to your family history. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members, and if so, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: Family history, yeah, there's some of that. My mom had her own set of troubles. Depression, I think they called it. She was in and out of the doctor's office, took a lot of different pills over the years. Never seemed to get much better, though. And my brother, he's had his run-ins with substance stuff too, went through rehab a couple of times. It's like this stuff just runs in the family, you know? Not sure if it's the genes or just bad luck. They got some help, sure, but it's hard to say if it did much good. Seems like we've all been fighting our own battles, one way or another.

Assistant: It sounds like mental health and substance use challenges have touched your family in significant ways. It's insightful to recognize patterns and consider both genetic and environmental factors. Regarding your family, is there a history of neurological or genetic conditions, and if so, who, and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: Neurological or genetic stuff, that's a bit harder to pin down. I mean, my granddad had something going on, some kind of dementia in his later years. Not sure if that counts. He was pretty old, and back then, people just said he was "getting senile" or whatever. Don't think he got much in the way of treatment, just kind of faded away with it. And there might've been some talk about an aunt or cousin with epilepsy, but that's not something we talked much about in the family. It's like once someone's got a label, that's all anyone sees, you know? So, we didn't dig too deep into it, just dealt with things as they came.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that, Rebecca. It's important to acknowledge how perceptions and treatments of neurological and genetic conditions have evolved over time. Now, could you tell me about your siblings? If you have any, I'd like to know each sibling's basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation.

User: Oh, my siblings, yeah. Well, there's my brother, like I mentioned. He's been through his own share of troubles. But getting into all their names, ages, and what they do, I'd rather not get too into the specifics, you know? They've got their lives, and with everything going on, I don't want to drag them into my mess more than necessary. They're out there, doing their best, just like I am. We try to keep in touch, support each other when we can. But yeah, let's leave it at that, if that's alright.

Assistant: Absolutely, Rebecca. We respect your privacy and the privacy of your family. Let's move on to your personal history. Could you tell me where you were born? If it was outside Canada, could you also share the year of your arrival?

User: I was born right here in Canada. Never had to deal with moving countries or anything like that. Just been moving around within the same borders, you know? Different towns, different challenges. But yeah, Canadian through and through, from the start.

Assistant: It's great to have that continuity of being in one country. Are you a Canadian citizen then?

User: Yeah, I'm a Canadian citizen. Born and raised, like I said. It's been an interesting ride, but this is home, through and through.

Assistant: Thank you for confirming that, Rebecca. Were there any complications during your birth that you're aware of?

User: Complications during my birth? Yeah, I think my mom mentioned something about it being a tough delivery. Took a long time, and there were some worries, but in the end, I made it here alright. Don't know all the details, just that it wasn't easy for her. Things were different back then, not as much talk about what went wrong, just gratitude for what went right, I guess.

Assistant: I appreciate you sharing what you know about your birth. It's true that perspectives and practices around childbirth have evolved. Moving on, at a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids, or were there any notable differences?

User: Oh, well, growing up was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I was always a bit on the slow side, you know? Took me a while to get the hang of talking and walking. My folks were worried for a bit, thought maybe something was wrong. And making friends, that wasn't easy either. I was the quiet one, kind of kept to myself. Had a hard time fitting in, always felt a bit out of step with the other kids. It's like I was marching to a beat only I could hear. School was tough, too, never really caught on like the others. Just felt different, I guess.

Assistant: It sounds like those early years presented some challenges for you, but also shaped who you are. Difficulties in fitting in can be tough, especially as a child. How about your experiences in elementary school? Did you face any particular difficulties there?

User: Elementary school, yeah, that was rough. Like I said, I was always a bit behind, felt like I was playing catch-up. Reading and math, those were tough. I remember feeling pretty lost most of the time. Teachers tried to help, but I just couldn't seem to get it. And the other kids, well, kids can be mean when you're not like them. Got picked on a bit for being slow. It was a lonely time, made me dread going to school. Just didn't fit in, no matter how hard I tried. Ended up keeping to myself a lot, just waiting for the day to be over so I could go home.

Assistant: It must have been incredibly challenging to navigate those feelings of isolation and struggle during your elementary school years. Those experiences can be very impactful. Moving forward, did you have any traumatic experiences growing up that you feel comfortable sharing?

User: Yeah, there were a few things, I guess. Life wasn't always kind. My family, we had our share of troubles. Money was tight, and there was a lot of arguing at home. That kind of tension, it sticks with you, you know? And then, well, there was this one time, something bad happened with a family friend. I don't really like to talk about it much. It's one of those things that's hard to shake off, even after all these years. Made me see the world a bit differently, trust people a lot less. And then just the usual scrapes and bruises life throws at you. It's been a journey, that's for sure. But talking about it, dredging it all up, that's tough. I prefer to try and keep looking forward, best I can.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Rebecca. It's understandable that revisiting those experiences is difficult. Focusing on moving forward is a resilient approach. To continue, could you tell me about your average mark and favorite topic or class in high school?

User: High school, huh? Well, my marks weren't anything to brag about. I was pretty much scraping by, you know? Just doing enough to get through. As for a favorite topic or class, that's a tough one. Never really felt like I belonged in any of them. But if I had to pick, maybe art class was okay. It was one of the few places I didn't feel completely out of my depth. Didn't matter if you were good at it or not, you could just sort of lose yourself in whatever you were working on. It was a break from everything else, at least for a little while. But yeah, school was mostly just something to get through, not something I enjoyed.

Assistant: Art class sounds like it was a valuable outlet for you, offering a space to express yourself and find some solace during those years. After high school, did you pursue any further education or training? If yes, where and what type of studies?

User: No, I didn't go for any further education or training after high school. Once I was done, I was just done, you know? The thought of sitting in more classes, trying to keep up, it just wasn't for me. I jumped into working, just odd jobs here and there. Nothing that really needed any special training or education. I've picked up things along the way, learned from the school of hard knocks, I guess you could say. Life's been my teacher, throwing lessons at me whether I wanted them or not. But formal education, college, or anything like that, it just wasn't in the cards.

Assistant: It sounds like you've gained a lot of valuable experience through the various jobs and life lessons along the way. Speaking of work, could you share a bit about your previous work history, such as companies you've worked for and years of work?

User: Oh, my work history's a bit all over the place. I've done a bunch of different things, never really stayed in one spot too long. Let's see, I worked at a grocery store for a while, stocking shelves and working the cash register. That was a few years back. Then there was a stint at a local diner, waiting tables. Met a lot of interesting folks there. I've also done some cleaning jobs, offices, and such at night. It's quiet work, keeps you to yourself.

As for companies, they're mostly just small local businesses, nothing big or fancy. And the years, well, it's hard to keep track. I've been bouncing around different jobs since I left high school. It's been a mix of part-time and full-time, whatever I could get my hands on to pay the bills and keep going. It's been a bit of a scramble, but that's life, right? Always something new around the corner.

Assistant: Your diverse work experience certainly reflects adaptability and resilience, Rebecca. It's interesting to hear about the variety of roles you've taken on. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: Yeah, there's been a couple of attempts at that whole long-term relationship thing. Was married once, a long time ago. It didn't work out, though. We were young, thought we knew what we were doing, but life has a way of showing you otherwise. After that, there were a few relationships, nothing that stuck, though. It's hard, you know? Finding someone who gets you, who's willing to ride out the storms with you. These days, I'm in something casual, like I mentioned. It's easier, less pressure. But yeah, I've had my share of trying and hoping. Just haven't found that "forever" kind of thing. Life's complicated, and so am I, I guess.

Assistant: Navigating relationships can indeed be complex, and finding the right balance for oneself is important. Your experiences and insights are valuable. Let's shift gears a bit. What are some hobbies or activities you enjoy?

User: Hobbies, huh? Well, I've always had a bit of a thing for gardening. There's something about working with your hands, watching things grow, that's kind of soothing, you know? It's like, no matter what's going on, the plants just do their thing, grow, bloom, fade, and start all over again. It's grounding, in a way.

Then there's walking. I like to take long walks, just me and my thoughts, sometimes not even that. It's a way to clear my head, get a bit of peace. The world's so noisy, it's nice to find a bit of quiet now and then.

And art, like I mentioned before, it's always been a bit of an escape for me. I'm not what you'd call talented, but I like messing around with paints and stuff. It's not about making something great, just making something, you know? It's a way to let out whatever's bottled up inside without having to put it into words.

So yeah, gardening, walking, and a bit of painting. Nothing fancy, but it's what I like.

Assistant: Your hobbies sound wonderfully therapeutic and fulfilling, providing a sense of peace and a creative outlet. It's great that you have found activities that bring you joy and help you relax. Speaking of relaxation, what do you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: On a stressful day, huh? Well, besides the walking and the gardening, I guess there's a few things. Music's a big one for me. Just putting on some tunes and letting myself get lost in it. Doesn't really matter what kind, as long as it's got a good beat or a melody that catches me. Sometimes I just sit and listen, other times it's more about blasting it and maybe dancing around a bit, just letting go.

Then there's reading. I'm not one for heavy stuff, but a good story, something that takes me away from it all for a while, that can be real nice. Gives my mind a break from running in circles.

And, well, sometimes it's about turning everything off, sitting with a cup of tea, and just being. No distractions, no noise, just a bit of quiet. Doesn't always work, mind you, but when it does, it's like a little reset button.

So yeah, music, reading, and a bit of quiet. That's my recipe for trying to unwind after a tough day.

Assistant: It sounds like you have a healthy variety of strategies to cope with stress and find moments of calm in your day. Your approach to self-care and finding what works for you is commendable. 

Before we conclude, is there anything else you feel the doctor should know about your health, well-being, or any aspect of your life that we haven't covered?

User: Well, I guess the main thing is just that life's been a bit of a rollercoaster, you know? And sometimes, I feel like I'm just barely hanging on. The eating thing, the mood swings, the past stuff, it all just piles up. And I'm trying, really trying, to keep moving forward, but some days it feels like I'm stuck in the same old patterns.

I'm not great at asking for help, always been more of a "deal with it on your own" kind of person. But I'm starting to realize maybe that's not enough anymore. It's hard, though, opening up, trusting that someone might actually be able to help without just judging or giving up on me.

So, I guess what I want the doctor to know is that I'm here, I'm trying, and I'm hoping maybe this time will be different. Maybe this time, something will click, and things will start to get a bit better. But it's a big maybe, and it's scary to even think about getting my hopes up.

Anyway, thanks for listening, or, well, reading, I guess. It's been a lot, dumping all this out, but maybe it's a start, right?

Assistant: Rebecca, sharing your story, your struggles, and your hope for the future is a significant step, and it's been an honor to listen. Acknowledging the need for help and taking steps towards it shows incredible strength. Your efforts to move forward, your willingness to consider opening up, and your hope for things to get better are all very powerful. Dr. Tran will appreciate understanding where you're coming from and how best to support you in this journey.

Thank you for trusting this process and sharing so much with me today. It's indeed a start, and a positive one at that. If there's anything else you ever feel the need to share or discuss, please know that your healthcare team is here for you.

Thank you, and goodbye.
