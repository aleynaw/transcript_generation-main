Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Evan Phillipsâ€™s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on February 4 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Evan Phillips to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, sure. Let's get this over with.

Assistant: Great, thank you for your cooperation. Let's start with some general information. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: Deborah Brittany Mclaughlin.

Assistant: Thank you, Deborah. Do you have a preferred name you'd like us to use?

User: Just Deb is fine.

Assistant: Alright, Deb. What is your date of birth?

User: January 30, 1965.

Assistant: Thank you. May I know your sex?

User: Female.

Assistant: Got it. Can you tell me your current city or town of residence?

User: Lake Keith, British Columbia.

Assistant: Thank you, Deb. Are you currently single, married, or in a common-law relationship?

User: Windowed.

Assistant: I'm sorry for your loss. Do you have any children or dependents?

User: No, none.

Assistant: Understood. Are you currently working?

User: Yeah, I'm a sports development officer. Keeps me on my toes.

Assistant: That sounds like an interesting job. How long have you been working as a sports development officer?

User: Been at it for a good 15 years now.

Assistant: That's quite a tenure. Have you ever been on disability assistance?

User: Nope, never needed it.

Assistant: Good to know. What about your handedness - are you left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous?

User: Right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing. Could you tell me about your current doctors?

User: Honestly, don't see them much. Just Dr. Phillips for the panic stuff. Not big on doctors, feel like they don't really get it, you know?

Assistant: I understand that it can be difficult to feel understood. It's important to have healthcare professionals you feel comfortable with. Do you have any known allergies?

User: Yeah, opioid pain meds and shellfish. They're off the table for me.

Assistant: Noted, I'll make sure Dr. Phillips is aware of your allergies. Could you tell me about any current medications and their dosages that you're taking?

User: Taking Clonazapam for the panic. Sorry, not great with spelling on that one.

Assistant: That's alright, you're likely referring to Clonazepam. Do you know the dosage you're currently taking?

User: Yeah, it's 0.5 mg. Take it as needed, not every day.

Assistant: Understood, it's helpful to have that detail. Are you taking any health supplements?

User: No, nothing like that. Just the occasional vitamin D in the winter months.

Assistant: Got it, thank you. How often do you use nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol?

User: Don't smoke. I'll have a drink maybe once a week, nothing crazy. As for marijuana, sometimes on the weekends to unwind. And, well, shrooms but that's not a regular thing, more like once in a blue moon.

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your usage. Let's move on to your medical history. Can you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've had, including details such as when you were diagnosed?

User: Got diagnosed with panic disorder a few years back. That's the main thing. Other than that, just the usual ups and downs.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?

User: Nope, been lucky on that front. No surgeries or hospital stays.

Assistant: That's good to hear. Have you ever had any head injuries or concussions?

User: No, nothing like that. Been pretty careful.

Assistant: I'm glad to hear you've been safe. Have you ever had a history of seizures?

User: No seizures either.

Assistant: Great, that simplifies things. Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling?

User: No rehab or counseling for substances. Never felt I needed it.

Assistant: Understood. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health? If yes, could you tell me who, when, and why?

User: Not really, aside from the occasional visit to a GP for the flu or minor things. Mostly just Dr. Phillips for the panic stuff. Like I said, not big on seeing doctors. Always feels like they're just ticking boxes instead of listening, you know?

Assistant: It's important to feel heard by your healthcare providers. I'll make sure to note your feelings about this. Let's shift to your family history. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members? If yes, who and did they receive treatment or hospital care?

User: Yeah, my mom had something similar, lots of anxiety, but back then, people didn't talk about it much. She never got official treatment, just dealt with it on her own. My brother's been in and out of therapy for depression. Seems like it runs in the family, but we're not the type to sit around and chat about our feelings all day.

Assistant: It sounds like mental health challenges have touched your family, but I appreciate the resilience you're showing. Is there a family history of neurological or genetic conditions?

User: Not that I know of. No big genetic things or neurological issues. Just the usual aging stuff as far as I'm aware.

Assistant: Thank you for clarifying. Do you have any siblings besides the brother you mentioned? If yes, could you provide their basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation?

User: Yeah, got another brother and a sister. My sister's living out in Alberta, working as a teacher. She's 56. My other brother's closer, in Vancouver, doing something with tech, always changing companies. He's 61. We're not super close, but we catch up now and then.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. It helps to have a picture of your family structure. Now, let's talk about your personal history. Where were you born?

User: Born right here in British Columbia. Been around Lake Keith most of my life.

Assistant: It's great to have such strong roots in one place. Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: Yes, born and raised. Canadian through and through.

Assistant: Thank you for confirming. Were there any complications during your birth?

User: Not that I've been told. Pretty standard from what I know.

Assistant: That's good to hear. As a child, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids your age?

User: Yeah, but I was a bit on the shy side, took me a bit longer to warm up to people. Had a few close friends rather than a big group. Walking and talking were on track, though.

Assistant: It's quite common to have a smaller circle of close friends. How about your experiences in elementary school? Did you face any difficulties?

User: Was pretty average in elementary. Didn't stand out much, just got through it. Had a bit of trouble with reading early on but caught up eventually.

Assistant: It's good to hear you were able to catch up. Did you experience any traumatic events growing up?

User: Yeah, had a few rough spots. Lost my dad when I was pretty young, which hit us all hard. And there was a car accident in my teens. No physical injuries for me, but it shook me up pretty bad.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear about those experiences, especially losing your dad at a young age and the car accident. It's understandable how such events could have a lasting impact. Moving on to a lighter topic, what was your average mark and favorite subject or class in high school?

User: Marks were pretty good, mostly Bs. Really liked gym and anything to do with sports. Always felt more at home on the field or in the gym than in a classroom.

Assistant: It's great that you found something you enjoyed and excelled in. Did you pursue further education after high school? If yes, where and what type of studies?

User: Went to college for sports management. Felt like a natural step, combining my love for sports with something practical. It was a good fit for me.

Assistant: That sounds like a perfect blend of your interests and practical skills. Could you share a bit about your previous work history, including companies and years of work, before your current position?

User: Before landing my current role, I worked for a local community center, managing their sports programs. Was there for about 10 years. Before that, did some coaching for kids' soccer teams right out of college. Always been involved in sports one way or another.

Assistant: It's clear you have a strong passion for sports and have built a career around it. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: Yeah, was married once. Lost my husband a few years back. We were together for a good chunk of my life. Haven't really been in the dating scene since. It's been tough, but I'm managing.

Assistant: I'm truly sorry for your loss. It sounds like you had a meaningful partnership. It's understandable how challenging navigating life after such a loss can be. On a different note, what are some hobbies or activities you enjoy?

User: Thanks. As for hobbies, still love anything active. Hiking, biking, and when I can, skiing in the winter. Keeps me grounded, you know? Also, got a bit of a green thumb, love working in my garden. It's my little escape.

Assistant: It sounds like you've found some beautiful ways to stay active and find peace. How do you like to relax on a stressful day?

User: On a rough day, I'll maybe light some candles, put on some music, and just try to chill. Sometimes I'll smoke a bit of weed to take the edge off. Helps me unwind and not get too caught up in my head.

Assistant: It's important to have strategies that help you unwind and cope with stress. Thank you for sharing your methods with me. Lastly, is there anything specific you think the doctor needs to know that we haven't covered yet?

User: Not really. Guess it's just that sometimes, despite everything, the panic just hits out of nowhere. It's like a wave, and it doesn't always make sense. The medication helps, but it's not a fix-all. Just want to find a way to feel more... steady, I guess. That's about it.

Assistant: Your feelings are completely valid, and it's understandable to seek more stability. I'll make sure to convey this to Dr. Phillips, emphasizing your desire for steadiness and how the panic can feel overwhelming at times. Thank you for being open and sharing your experiences with me. Your insights are invaluable for understanding your needs and how best to support you. If there's nothing else, I believe we have covered everything necessary for now. Thank you, and goodbye.
