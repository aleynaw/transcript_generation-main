Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Michael Tran’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on February 28 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Michael Tran to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, okay, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take forever. I’m not too sure how much help talking is gonna be, but let’s get this over with.

Assistant: Thank you for agreeing to speak with me, Rebecca. Let's start with some general information for our records. Could you please confirm your full name and if there's a name you prefer to go by?

User: It’s Rebecca Jillian Smith, but just call me Becky, everyone does.

Assistant: Thank you, Becky. Now, could you tell me your date of birth?

User: November 24, 1962.

Assistant: Great, thank you. Are you currently working?

User: Nah, I've been out of work for a while now. Just can't seem to fit in, you know?

Assistant: I understand, that can be really challenging. Do you receive any form of disability assistance?

User: Nope, nothing like that. Just getting by, I guess.

Assistant: Got it. How about your handedness? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or both?

User: Right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me about any current or past doctors you've seen for your health?

User: I've seen a few over the years, but it feels like they never really get what's going on with me. Just a bunch of appointments and prescriptions.

Assistant: I hear you, it can feel frustrating not being understood. Speaking of prescriptions, are you currently taking any medications?

User: Yeah, I'm on Zolof for my moods or whatever they said it was for.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Do you happen to know the dosage of your Zoloft medication?

User: It's like 100 mg, I think.

Assistant: Got it, 100 mg of Zoloft. Do you have any allergies we should be aware of?

User: Yeah, opioids, latex, and fragrances. They all mess me up pretty bad.

Assistant: Noted, thank you for letting me know. How about health supplements? Are you taking any?

User: No, none of those.

Assistant: Understood. Could you tell me about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use?

User: I’ve had my phases, you know? But these days, not so much. Maybe a drink now and then.

Assistant: I appreciate your honesty, Becky. Let's move on to your medical history. Can you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received, including details like when you were diagnosed?

User: Well, there’s this thing where I can’t stop eating sometimes. They called it binge-eating disorder. Got that label a few years back.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Becky. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?

User: No surgeries, but been in the hospital a couple of times. Once for a seizure, another time... well, it was a tough time, you know?

Assistant: I’m sorry to hear that. Do you recall when you first experienced a seizure?

User: Hmm, it’s been a while. Probably started around 10 years ago.

Assistant: Thank you for that information. Have you ever had any head injuries or concussions?

User: Not really, no big accidents or anything.

Assistant: I see. Have you ever sought treatment for rehab or substance counselling?

User: Yeah, had a bit of a rough patch with drinking a while back. Went to some counseling sessions, maybe 5 years ago?

Assistant: It's good to hear you sought help. Do you remember where you went for counseling?

User: Some community health center here in town. Can't remember the name.

Assistant: That's okay, Becky. Thank you for sharing that. Now, moving on to your family history. Do you have any family members with psychiatric conditions?

User: My mom had depression, pretty bad. She was in and out of the hospital when I was younger.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been challenging. Do you know if there's a family history of neurological or genetic conditions?

User: Not that I know of, no.

Assistant: Understood. Could you tell me a bit about your siblings?

User: Yeah, I’ve got a brother and a sister. They’re both older and live out of town. We don’t talk much.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing. Now, let’s talk a bit about your personal history. Where were you born?

User: Right here in Acostatown, British Columbia.

Assistant: Have you always lived in Canada, then?

User: Yep, never lived anywhere else.

Assistant: Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: Yeah, born and raised.

Assistant: Did you experience any birth complications, to your knowledge?

User: Not that I’ve ever been told, no.

Assistant: At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: I guess so, but I always felt a bit off, you know? Like, I never quite fit in anywhere.

Assistant: It can be tough feeling like you don't fit in. Did you face any difficulties in elementary school?

User: Oh, for sure. I was always the odd one out. Couldn’t keep up with the others, and teachers didn’t really know what to do with me.

Assistant: That sounds like it was really challenging. Moving on, did you experience any traumatic experiences growing up?

User: Yeah, there were a few things. It’s hard to talk about, you know? Just family stuff and feeling really alone a lot.

Assistant: I understand, and it's okay. We can move at a pace that's comfortable for you. How about your high school performance? What were your average marks and favorite subject?

User: Marks were pretty bad, barely passed. But I kinda liked art class. It was the only place I felt a bit okay.

Assistant: Art can be a wonderful outlet. Did you pursue further education after high school?

User: No, I didn’t. Just didn’t seem like an option for me, you know?

Assistant: That's completely okay. Everyone's path is different. Can you tell me about your previous work history?

User: Worked a bunch of random jobs. Nothing ever stuck for long. Retail, fast food, that sort of thing.

Assistant: It can be difficult to find the right fit. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: A couple, but nothing that lasted. I’m in something casual now, but it’s not serious.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. What are some hobbies you enjoy?

User: I like painting and going for walks. Helps clear my head, you know?

Assistant: Painting and walking are great ways to relax. Speaking of which, what do you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: Painting, like I said. And sometimes, I’ll just binge-watch shows to distract myself.

Assistant: It's good to have strategies that help. Lastly, is there anything else you think the doctor should know about your situation?

User: Just that I’m really tired, you know? Tired of feeling this way. Not sure how much hope I have left that things can get better.

Assistant: I hear you, Becky, and it's important that you shared that. Feeling tired and low on hope is understandable given what you've been through. Dr. Tran will want to explore how he can support you towards feeling better. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me today. Your honesty and openness are truly appreciated.
