I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Bonnie Le to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, pet dander gets to me.

Assistant: Noted. And could you share with me the current medications you are on, including dosage?
