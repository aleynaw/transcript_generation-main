Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, sure. I guess it's okay to talk a bit. What do you need to know?

Assistant: Noted. Could you list any current doctors you see regularly?

User: Just my family doctor, Dr. Susan Kline.

Assistant: Thank you, Deb. Do you have any known allergies?

User: Yeah, opioid pain medications and shellfish.

Assistant: It's important to have that noted. What about current medications and their dosage?

User: I take Clonazapam for my nerves. But I'm not sure if I spelled that right.

Assistant: That's okay, Deb. You're likely referring to Clonazepam. Do you know the dosage you're currently taking?

User: It's 0.5 mg, I take it twice a day.

Assistant: Got it, 0.5 mg twice a day. Do you take any health supplements?

User: No, none.

Assistant: How often do you use nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Let's move on to your medical history. Can you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you have, including details such as when you were diagnosed?

User: I was diagnosed with panic disorder, oh, must've been about 5 years ago now.

Assistant: I see. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?

User: No, nothing like that.

Assistant: Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions?

User: No seizures either.

Assistant: Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling?

User: Nope, never needed it.

Assistant: Alright. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health?

User: Just a therapist for a bit when I was first diagnosed. Haven't been back in a while, though.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing. Let's discuss your family history a bit. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members?

User: Yeah, my mom had depression pretty bad. She was in and out of the hospital for it.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know of any family history of neurological or genetic conditions?

User: Yeah, two brothers.

Assistant: Could you tell me a bit about them, such as their names, ages, where they live, and what they do for a living?

User: Sure. Mike's 61, lives here in Lake Keith too, he's a mechanic. And then there's Joe, he's 56 and lives over in Vancouver, works in IT.

Assistant: Thanks for sharing that, Deb. Now, moving on to your personal history. Where were you born?

User: Right here in Lake Keith.

Assistant: Since you were born in Canada, I'll skip the citizenship and arrival questions. Were there any complications during your birth?

User: Not that I've been told, no.

Assistant: As a young child, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: Yeah, but I was always a bit shy, took me longer to make friends.

Assistant: Did you face any difficulties in elementary school?

User: Just the usual for a shy kid, I guess. Nothing major.

Assistant: How about any traumatic experiences growing up?

User: My dad passed away when I was pretty young. That was tough.

User: Yeah, I was married for a while. He passed away a few years back.

Assistant: I'm truly sorry for your loss. What are some of your hobbies?

User: I like hiking, reading, and sometimes painting.

Assistant: Those sound like wonderful activities. What do you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: A walk usually helps. Or just chilling with a book.

Assistant: It's good to have those go-to activities for stress relief. Lastly, is there anything you believe the doctor should know that we haven't covered?

User: I guess... just that sometimes I feel really down, and it's hard to shake it off. Not sure if it's related to my panic disorder or something else.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Deb. It's important for us to understand the full picture of your wellbeing. I'll make sure to note that for Dr. Phillips. This concludes our interview. Thank you for your time and for being open with me today. Your next step is to meet with Dr. Phillips on February 4. Do you have any questions or concerns before we end our conversation?

User: No, I think that's everything. Thanks for being easy to talk to.

Assistant: You're very welcome, Deb. If you have any questions or need to talk before your appointment, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I look forward to your visit with Dr. Phillips.
