Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Denise Fields’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on October 16 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Denise Fields to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, sure. I guess that's okay. Just not sure how much help all this is gonna be, you know?

Assistant: I understand your concerns, Danielle. It's completely normal to feel that way, especially before meeting with a doctor. Every piece of information you provide helps us to understand your situation better and tailor the care to your needs. Let's start with some basic information. Could you confirm your full name and if there's a name you'd prefer to go by?

User: It's Danielle Jodi Bolton. But Dani is fine, everyone calls me that.

Assistant: Thank you, Dani. Could you also confirm your date of birth for our records?

User: November 20, 1980.

Assistant: Great, thank you. Now, could you tell me a bit about where you're currently living?

User: I'm over at 632 James Ridges, South Juan, British Columbia.

Assistant: Got it, thank you. And what is your current relationship status?

User: In a long-term relationship.

Assistant: Thanks for sharing that. Do you have any children or dependents?

User: No, none.

Assistant: Understood. Are you currently working?

User: Yeah, I work as a sales promotion account executive.

Assistant: That sounds like an engaging job. How long have you been working there?

User: Been there for about 5 years now.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Do you receive any form of disability assistance?

User: No, nothing like that.

Assistant: Alright. Which hand do you primarily use, Dani?

User: I'm right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you. Could you tell me about any current doctors you're seeing?

User: Haven't really been seeing any doctors regularly.

Assistant: I see. Do you have any known allergies?

User: Yeah, pet dander, penicillin, and ibuprofen.

Assistant: Noted. And are you currently on any medications?

User: Just Sertraline.

Assistant: Could you specify the dosage of Sertraline you're taking?

User: It’s 100 mg daily.

Assistant: Thank you. Do you take any health supplements?

User: No, none.

Assistant: How often do you use nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol?

User: Don't use any of those.

Assistant: I appreciate your openness. Now, could you share any health conditions or diagnoses you have received, including details like when you were diagnosed?

User: Well, I've got this thing where I can't stop eating sometimes. It's like, I know I should stop, but I just can't. I guess they called it binge-eating disorder. Got diagnosed a couple of years ago.

Assistant: I understand that must be challenging for you. Thank you for sharing that with me. Have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries?

User: No, nothing like that.

Assistant: Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions?

User: No head injuries.

Assistant: And have you had a history of seizures?

User: Yeah, had a few episodes. Started around when I was 20.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you ever been in rehab or received substance counseling?

User: No, never needed anything like that.

Assistant: It's good to hear that you haven't felt the need for those services. Have you seen any other medical professionals for your health concerns?

User: Not really, just the one who diagnosed the eating thing.

Assistant: Understood. Moving on to your family history, have any of your family members had psychiatric conditions?

User: Not that I know of. We don't really talk about that stuff in my family.

Assistant: That's quite common in many families. What about a history of neurological or genetic conditions in your family?

User: Nope, nothing like that either.

Assistant: Okay, thank you. Do you have any siblings?

User: No, I'm an only child.

Assistant: Got it. Now, let's talk a bit about your personal history. Where were you born?

User: Right here in Canada.

Assistant: And have you always been a Canadian citizen?

User: Yeah, born and raised.

Assistant: Did you face any complications at birth?

User: Not that I've been told.

Assistant: How about your developmental milestones, like walking, talking, and developing friendships? Did you experience these similarly to other kids?

User: Yeah, pretty much. Though I guess I was always a bit on the shy side.

Assistant: It's quite normal for children to have varying social comfort levels. How did you find your experience in elementary school?

User: It was tough. I didn't do well, academically or socially. Always felt kinda out of place.

Assistant: I'm sorry to hear that. It can be really challenging to feel that way during formative years. How about high school? How did you perform academically, and what was your favorite subject?

User: Things were average, I guess. Managed to get by. Liked art class the best, felt most at ease there.

Assistant: Art can be a wonderful outlet. Have you pursued any further education after high school?

User: No, jumped straight into work.

Assistant: That's a path many take. Could you tell me a bit about your previous work history?

User: Worked a few retail jobs before landing the one I have now. Nothing too exciting.

Assistant: Every experience contributes to where we are today. Have you had any previous marriages or long-term relationships before the current one?

User: Had a couple of serious relationships, but nothing stuck until now.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing. What do you enjoy doing in your free time? Any hobbies?

User: I like reading and sometimes painting. Helps to distract me, you know?

Assistant: Absolutely, hobbies can be very therapeutic. What do you usually do to relax on a stressful day?

User: Reading mostly, or just zoning out to some TV show.

Assistant: Sounds like a good way to unwind. Lastly, is there anything specific you believe the doctor should know about?

User: Just that I'm skeptical about all this helping. Been through a lot and don't really see how talking is gonna change things.

Assistant: Your feelings are valid, Dani. It's okay to be skeptical. The important thing is that you're taking steps towards seeking help, and that in itself is a big move. Dr. Fields will be keen to understand your perspective and work with you at your pace. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Your information will be very helpful for your upcoming appointment.

User: Thanks, I guess. We'll see how it goes.

Assistant: You're welcome, and remember, it's perfectly fine to have doubts. The clinic is here to support you. If you have any questions before your appointment, feel free to reach out. Take care, Dani.
