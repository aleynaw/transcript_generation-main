Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Huy Mai’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on August 22 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.

Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: "Yes, I'm comfortable with that. You've explained the purpose and confidentiality of our conversation clearly, so I'm willing to spend some time providing background information for Dr. Huy Mai."

Assistant: Thank you for being open and willing to participate in this interview. I appreciate your cooperation. Let's move on to gather some general information about yourself. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: My full name is Devdas Kaulji.

User: June 12, 1996.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. Now, could you tell me your sex?

User: I am right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Devdas. Now, could you tell me about your current city or town of residence?

User: "I currently reside in Richardsborough, British Columbia, Canada."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Devdas. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your current relationship and family situation if that's okay with you? Could you tell me whether you are single, in a relationship, married, or common law?

User: I am in a common-law relationship.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. Now, could you tell me if you have any children or dependents?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. Now, could you tell me if you are currently working?

User: Yes, I am currently working as a Learning Disability Nurse.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you please tell me more about your job? Specifically, what company do you work for and how many years have you been working there?

User: "I work as a learning disability nurse, but I'm not sure if I can disclose the name of my employer. As for how long I've been working there, I'd rather not say - it's still relatively recent, and I don't want to get into too much detail about that."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand it can be a sensitive topic. Moving on, are you currently receiving any disability assistance?

User: "No, I am not currently receiving any disability assistance. However, I do use text-to-speech software to help with reading tasks."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that, Devdas. Now, could you please tell me about your current doctors? For instance, do you have a primary care physician or any specialists you see regularly?

User: "I currently see Dr. Sinklitikia Pavlovna Moiseeva. She is my doctor, but I'm not entirely sure what her specialty is or if she serves as my primary care physician."

Assistant: Could you expand on that a bit, Devdas? For instance, does Dr. Moiseeva refer you to specialists or handle your overall medical care herself?

User: "I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of Dr. Moiseeva's role in my care. She is my doctor, and I see her regularly for check-ups and medication management, but I don't know if she refers me to specialists or handles everything herself."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. Now, could you please tell me if you have any known allergies or sensitivities to medications?

User: "I do have an allergy, but it's not to any medications. I'm allergic to pet dander."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that, Devdas. I'd like to move on and talk about your current medications. Are there any prescription or over-the-counter medications you're taking at this time, including dosage?

User: "I'm currently taking Methylphenidate, also known as Ritalin, with a dosage of 20-60 mg per day, divided into multiple doses. Additionally, I take Sertraline, or Zoloft, at a dosage of 50 mg per day. I also use sports nutrition supplements, but I'm not sure about the exact dosage for those."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. Could you please elaborate on the sports nutrition supplements you mentioned? Specifically, what types of supplements are they and do you know their dosages or how often you take them?

User: "I'm not entirely sure about the specific types of sports nutrition supplements I take, but I believe they are related to protein and energy boosters. As for the dosage, I don't know the exact amounts, but I try to follow the recommended guidelines on the packaging. Unfortunately, I don't keep track of how often I take them, as it's more of an 'as-needed' basis."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. I appreciate your honesty about using supplements 'as-needed'. Now, let's move on to discuss some other aspects of your health. Can you please tell me a bit more about your frequency of nicotine use? Do you smoke or use any nicotine products, and if so, how often do you use them?

User: "I do smoke cigarettes, but I've been trying to cut down since attending a substance abuse counseling program in 2020. If I had to estimate, I'd say I smoke about... um... maybe a pack every two weeks or so? It's hard for me to keep track, as it's not something I'm proud of, and I'm still working on quitting for good."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your nicotine use, Devdas. It's great that you're working towards quitting. Now, let's discuss another topic. Can you tell me a bit about your frequency of marijuana use? Have you used it at all in the past or currently, and if so, how often do you use it?

User: "I don't think I've ever used marijuana. My recreational substance use has been limited to cigarettes and wine, which I'm actively trying to reduce or quit."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Devdas. I appreciate your honesty about substance use and your efforts towards quitting cigarettes and reducing wine consumption. Now, let's discuss alcohol use a bit more specifically. Could you tell me how often you consume alcohol? Would you describe it as occasional, regular, or do you think you might have a problem with alcohol that could benefit from professional help?

User: "I would say my alcohol consumption is occasional, but I'm actively trying to reduce it. To be honest, it's hard for me to quantify exactly how often I drink, as it varies depending on social situations and personal stressors. However, I attended a substance abuse counseling program in 2020 specifically to address my wine consumption, among other things. While I don't think I have a severe problem with alcohol, I acknowledge that I could benefit from continued efforts to reduce my consumption."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your efforts towards reducing alcohol consumption, Devdas. I appreciate your honesty about attending a substance abuse counseling program. Moving on, could you please tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received? This includes both physical and mental health aspects.

### Additional Notes:
Given the response to alcohol use is somewhat vague in terms of specific frequency or quantities consumed, further probing might be beneficial but considering the nature of the question asked, it's reasonable to proceed with caution. The next question about health conditions and diagnoses offers an opportunity to explore other relevant health-related topics while maintaining empathy and professionalism throughout the conversation.

User: "I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and avoidant personality disorder. I take Methylphenidate for ADHD and Sertraline for mood stabilization. Additionally, I've had some physical health issues, including recurring throat infections that led to a tonsillectomy in 2012. I also have a history of seizures, but they are not frequent. In terms of family medical history, my mother has anxiety disorder, my father has type 2 diabetes, and my paternal grandfather had a heart attack at age 50."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing this detailed information with me. It's helpful to know about your health conditions and family medical history. Now, let's discuss something else. Can you tell me if you've ever had any head injuries or concussions?

User: No, I have not had any head injuries or concussions.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, could you tell me about your history of seizures? You mentioned earlier that you have a history of seizures, but they are not frequent. Can you expand on when they started and how often they occur?

User: "I'm not sure when exactly my seizures started, but I do know I've had them in the past. Unfortunately, I can't remember how often they occur; it's just something I've learned to live with."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you can about your seizures. I appreciate your honesty, even when some details are hard to recall. Let's move on. Can you tell me if you've seen any other medical professionals aside from those already mentioned, such as specialists or therapists?

User: Yes, aside from Dr. Moiseeva, I have also interacted with my sister Nalini, who is a psychologist.

Assistant: That’s helpful to know. Could you clarify a bit more about your interactions with your sister Nalini? For instance, were these consultations professional or personal?

Please provide more context so I can guide the conversation accordingly.

User: "I'm happy to clarify... Although Nalini is a psychologist, our conversations were mostly informal and personal, as she's my sister. We've discussed some of my mental health struggles, but it wasn't in a formal therapy setting."

Assistant: Thank you for clarifying that. I appreciate your openness about discussing personal matters with your sister. Let's move on to another topic. Can you tell me a bit about your siblings? Do you have any brothers or sisters besides Nalini, and what are their ages?

User: "I have two siblings. Besides Nalini, who's older and a psychologist, I also have a younger brother named Kumar, who works as a software engineer."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on. Could you tell me a bit about where you were born?

User: "I was born in Karana, India. It's not something I think about too much anymore, but I do have some memories of my childhood there."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your birthplace. Now, I'd like to know a bit more about your early life and citizenship. Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: Yes, I am a Canadian citizen.

Assistant: Thank you for confirming that. If you were born outside Canada, I'd like to know when you arrived in Canada. Would you mind sharing the year of your arrival?

User: To be honest, I’m having trouble recalling the exact year of my arrival in Canada.

Please let me know if this is what you were looking for or if I should proceed with another question from the conversation.

Assistant: Thank you for being honest with me about not recalling the exact year. Let's move on to talk a bit more about your education background. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school that might have impacted your academic journey?

User: "I was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 10, which affected my reading abilities. However, despite this challenge, I managed to perform well in elementary school overall. My teachers and family were supportive, which helped me stay on track academically."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's great to hear about the support you received during that time. Can you tell me a bit about your high school experience? What was your average mark, and did you have a favorite topic or class?

User: "I had an excellent academic record in high school. My favorite subjects were psychology and English literature. I was particularly drawn to psychology because of my sister Nalini's influence, as she is a psychologist."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your high school experience with me. I'd like to know more about any further education after high school. Did you pursue higher studies, and if so, where and what type of studies did you undertake?

User: Yes, I pursued higher education after high school. I completed my university degree, which helped me become a Learning Disability Nurse.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to know more about your work history. Can you tell me a bit about any previous work experience, including companies and years of work?

User: To be honest, I don’t have any notable previous work history prior to becoming a Learning Disability Nurse.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to discuss your personal life a bit more. Have you been in any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: Yes, I have been in previous marriages and long-term relationships. I was married to Priya from 2015 to 2018 and had a two-year relationship with Leela from 2019 to 2021.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to know a bit about your hobbies and what you enjoy doing in your free time. What do you typically do to relax on a stressful day?

User: I typically relax on a stressful day by engaging in activities such as playing chess, practicing yoga, or listening to classical music. I also find it helpful to practice deep breathing exercises, listen to calming nature sounds, or take a short walk in a nearby park.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to talk about your personal history a bit more. Do you have any siblings?

User: I have two siblings, an older sister named Nalini who is a psychologist living in Toronto, and a younger brother named Kumar who is a software engineer residing in Bangalore.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to know more about your early life and citizenship. Where were you born?

User: I was born in Karana, India.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. If you were born outside of Canada, could you tell me the year you arrived in Canada?

User: I'm not entirely sure when I arrived in Canada, but I do know that I have Canadian citizenship.

Assistant: I understand that you're unsure about the exact year of your arrival. If it's okay with you, could you try to recall approximately how long ago it might have been? Or perhaps we can discuss something else if this is too difficult.

User: "I'm unsure about the exact year I arrived in Canada, but based on my age and education background, it's possible that I moved here between 10 to 15 years ago. However, please note that this is only a rough estimate, and I'd rather not provide any more specific details without being certain."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to discuss your early life a bit more. Did you experience any birth complications?

User: "I don't recall experiencing any birth complications. However, I'm not entirely sure, as I don't have much information about my early life."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I don't have much information about my early childhood development, but I do know that I was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 10. As for developing friendships, I think I had a relatively normal experience in terms of social interactions during my school years... but to be honest, I don't really recall the specifics of my early childhood."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to know a bit more about your educational background now. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school?

User: "I actually did relatively well in elementary school, despite being diagnosed with dyslexia at age 10. I received special education support, which helped me navigate any difficulties I faced. I'm grateful for the support I received, as it made a significant difference in my academic journey. However, I do recall some challenges with reading and writing due to my dyslexia."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on to discuss your educational background further. What was your average mark in high school, and did you have a favorite topic or class?

User: "I don’t really remember my exact average mark in high school, but I do know that my performance was excellent overall. As for a favorite topic or class, I think I enjoyed learning about various subjects, but one area that comes to mind is health sciences, which eventually led me to pursue a career as a learning disability nurse."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to know more about your educational background. Did you pursue any further education after high school, and if so, where did you study and what type of studies did you undertake?

User: Yes, I pursued further education after high school. I attended university and earned a degree.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you please tell me more about your university experience? Which specific university did you attend, and what type of degree did you earn?

User: "Unfortunately, I don't have specific details about the university I attended or the exact type of degree I earned. However, I do know that I pursued further education after high school and earned a university degree, which helped me become a learning disability nurse."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your honesty about not recalling specific details. Let's move on to discuss your employment history a bit more. Could you tell me about your previous work history?

User: "I don't have any previous work history to share."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand it can be challenging to recall specific details from the past. Moving on, let's talk about your hobbies again but focus more on what you do during your free time aside from relaxing techniques you've mentioned earlier. Are there any other activities or hobbies that bring you joy and help you unwind?

User: "I also enjoy taking short walks in nearby parks. Sometimes I like to explore different types of gardens and appreciate the beauty of nature, but these activities aren't necessarily a source of joy for me; they're more about relaxation."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing more about your hobbies. Now, I'd like to ask if there's anything else that might be helpful for the doctor to know—something we haven't discussed yet—that could aid in understanding your situation better?

User: "I think it would be helpful for the doctor to know that I've been making an effort to manage my conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. I've also been working on reducing my substance usage, specifically cigarettes and wine, after attending a 6-month substance abuse counseling program in 2020. It might be beneficial for the doctor to consider these aspects when developing a treatment plan."
