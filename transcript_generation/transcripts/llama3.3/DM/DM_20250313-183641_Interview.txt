Assistant: Thank you, Kesar. It's helpful to know your full name for our records. Could you please share with me your preferred name, if different from your full name?

User: "To be honest, I'm not really sure what you mean by 'preferred name.' I've always gone by my full name, which is Kesar Thapa. I don't think I have a different preferred name, but please let me know if I'm misunderstanding the question!"

Assistant: Thank you for clarifying that, Kesar. Let's move on. Could you please share your date of birth with me?

Assistant: That's great to hear that you've been able to manage independently. Now, let's move on to discuss your medical history a bit more. Could you please tell me about your current doctors?

User: I currently see Dr. Youngsoo Park as my doctor.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?

User: "I think I had a rash once from peanuts... or maybe it was just a skin irritation? To be honest, I'm not really sure if I'm allergic to anything. It's always been a bit unclear."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your concerns about potential allergies. I appreciate your honesty in expressing uncertainty. Could you tell me a bit about any current medications and dosages you're taking, if that's okay?

User: "I do have a history of substance abuse... it's something I've struggled with in the past. To be honest, I'm not really sure about the exact frequency of my use; it's been an ongoing issue for me."

(Note: Please go ahead and ask your next question as the psychiatric assistant.)

Assistant: Thank you for being honest about your substance use history. I appreciate your willingness to discuss such personal topics. Moving forward, let's talk about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received and details like when they were diagnosed?

User: "I have been diagnosed with bulimia, which was diagnosed... um, I think it was around 2018 when I was hospitalized for complications related to it. I've also had some other health issues, like a torn ligament in my ankle that required minor surgery in 2020. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure about the exact date of the bulimia diagnosis, but I know it was around the time I was hospitalized in 2018."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing those details about your health conditions and diagnoses. Now, I'd like to discuss any past accidents or injuries you may have experienced. Have you ever had a history of head injuries or concussions?

User: No, I don't have any history of head injuries or concussions.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on to discuss another topic. Have you ever experienced any seizures?

User: No, I don't think I've ever had any seizures.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your experiences with me; I appreciate your honesty. Now, I'd like to ask if you've ever attended rehabilitation or received counseling specifically related to your struggles with substance use?

User: "I'm not sure if I've ever attended rehabilitation specifically for substance use, but I have been taking Topiramate (Topamax) as prescribed by my doctor. To be honest, I don't really remember discussing substance use treatment with him, but I do recall talking about managing stress and anxiety."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on rehabilitation and counseling. Could you clarify if you've ever had any formal therapy sessions, either individually or in a group setting? If so, could you tell me more about those experiences? Additionally, moving forward, I'd like to ask: Have you seen other medical professionals besides your current doctor, such as specialists or therapists?

User: "I've seen other medical professionals for specific issues, like when I was hospitalized for bulimia complications in 2018 or when I had surgery for a torn ligament in my ankle in 2020."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you expand on who these other medical professionals were, such as specialists or therapists, and approximately when you saw them, especially in relation to your struggles with bulimia?

User: "I'm not sure if I saw any specific specialists during my hospitalization in 2018, but I do remember talking to a therapist who specialized in eating disorders. She was part of the treatment team at the hospital. I think her name was... uh... Dr. Rachel something. I'm sorry, I don't recall her last name. As for other medical professionals, I'm sure there were nurses and doctors who took care of me during my stay, but I don't really remember them specifically. I wish I could recall more details about the therapist I saw, but it's been a few years since then. I do remember that she was very helpful in addressing some of my concerns and worries related to bulimia."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I understand it can be difficult to recall specific details, especially from a few years ago. Moving forward, I'd like to ask about your family history related to mental and neurological health. Is there any history of psychiatric conditions in other family members?

User: "Yes, my family does have a history of psychiatric conditions. My mother has struggled with depression, and one of my younger siblings has been diagnosed with ADHD. Additionally, my father has high blood pressure, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to any mental health conditions. I'm a bit concerned about my family history, especially since I've been dealing with bulimia myself. But at the same time, it's good to know that there are people in my family who have struggled with similar issues and have come out on top."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your openness about your family's health struggles. Now, could you tell me more about whether any of these family members have received treatment or hospital care for their conditions? For example, has your mother seen a therapist or psychiatrist for her depression, and what kind of support has she received?

User: "I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of my family members' treatments. My mother has talked about seeing a therapist for her depression, but I don't think she's ever been hospitalized for it. As for my sibling with ADHD, I know they've received some kind of treatment, possibly therapy or medication, but I don't have the details. My father's high blood pressure is something he manages through lifestyle changes and medication, but again, I'm not aware of any specific hospitalizations related to that condition. I wish I had more information about their specific treatments and hospitalizations, but unfortunately, this is all I know at this point."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you know about your family's treatment and hospitalization history. I understand it can be challenging when we're not always privy to specific details, especially within families. Moving on, could you tell me a bit more about your siblings? How many do you have, and are they older or younger than you?

User: "I have two younger siblings, a brother who is 20 years old and currently studying business in college, and an 18-year-old sister who is in her first year of university studying psychology."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your siblings' studies and ages. Could you tell me a bit more about where they live? Are they living away from home for university, or do they still reside at your family's home?

User: "I'm not entirely sure where they are living right now. Since my brother is studying business in college and my sister is in university, I think they might be living away from home, possibly in dorms or shared accommodations with friends. But to be honest, I don't have the most up-to-date information on their current living arrangements."

Assistant: Thank you for being honest about your uncertainty regarding your siblings' current living arrangements. I'd like to move on and ask another question. Where were you born?

User: "I was born in Shuklaphanta, Nepal."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me! If outside Canada, I would like to know when you arrived here. Could you please tell me what year you came to Canada?

User: "I'm not sure about the exact year I came to Canada, but I know I've been living here for some time now. As a Canadian citizen, I've made this country my home."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me! I appreciate your honesty about not knowing the exact year of arrival. Now, let's move on to discuss another topic. Are you a Canadian citizen by birth or naturalization?

User: "I'm a Canadian citizen, but not by birth. I was born in Nepal and later became a citizen through naturalization."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your citizenship. I appreciate your honesty about becoming a citizen through naturalization. Could you tell me more about any birth complications or issues that may have arisen during your delivery?

User: "I'm not aware of any birth complications or issues that may have arisen during my delivery. My patient profile doesn't mention anything about it, so I couldn't provide more details."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your birth. Now, let's move on and explore another topic. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I don't have any specific memories of having difficulties with walking or talking at a young age. As for developing friendships, I think I was able to make friends like other kids."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me! I'd like to discuss your education now. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school?

User: No, I didn't experience any significant difficulties in elementary school.

Assistant: That's helpful to know, thank you. Moving on to high school, what was your average mark, and do you remember a favorite topic or class during that time?

User: "My high school performance was average. I don't really remember any particular subject that I enjoyed more than others, but overall, my grades were just okay."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me! Now, let's talk about further education after high school. Did you pursue any further studies or training after completing high school?

User: "Yes, I did pursue further education after high school. I went on to earn a university degree."

Assistant: Could you expand on your university experience? What type of degree did you earn, and where did you attend?

User: "I apologize, but the specifics of my university experience are a bit fuzzy... I do know that I earned a degree in engineering, which helped me land my current job as a petroleum engineer."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your university experience. It can be difficult to recall specific details from that time. Letâ€™s move on to talk about other aspects of your life. What do you like to do in your free time? Do you have any hobbies or activities that bring you joy?

User: "I enjoy doing various activities in my free time. I like going for hikes, playing soccer with friends, getting lost in science fiction novels, and even learning new programming languages to keep my mind sharp."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your hobbies with me! Now, let's talk about how you relax on a stressful day. What do you typically do to unwind and calm down?

User: I try to unwind by practicing meditation and deep breathing exercises. Listening to calming music, such as classical music or nature sounds, also helps me relax.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, is there anything else that you think your doctor should know about your mental health history or current situation that we haven't discussed yet?

User: Actually, yes... I think it's worth mentioning that my mother has struggled with depression in the past, which might be relevant to my own mental health history.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your mother's history with me; thatâ€™s helpful information. Weâ€™ve now reached the end of our structured questions. If there are any other personal thoughts or feelings about your mental health journey that you'd like to discuss, please feel free to share them with me. Otherwise, I'll make sure this conversation gets summarized and shared appropriately.
