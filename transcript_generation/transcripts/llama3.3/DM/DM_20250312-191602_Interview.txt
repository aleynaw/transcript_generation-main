Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to talk about your development during childhood now. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "As a child with autism, I developed at my own pace. I'm not sure if I walked or talked exactly like other kids, but I do know I had difficulties making friends due to my social anxiety... it was always hard for me to connect with others."

User: "Yes, I did face some challenges in elementary school... mainly with social interactions and understanding certain lessons. My autism made it hard for me to connect with others and sometimes understand what was being taught. Despite that, I managed to perform average overall."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it helps a lot. Moving on, could you tell me about your experience in high school? Were there any specific difficulties or challenges you faced during that time, and what was your average mark in high school? Also, do you have a favorite topic or class from high school?

User: "My experience in high school was similar to elementary school; I still struggled with social interactions and understanding certain lessons due to my autism. However, I managed to perform average overall, just like in elementary school. My favorite topic or class from high school wasn't really a specific one, but I did enjoy learning about various subjects, which helped me decide to pursue further education after high school. I went on to earn a university degree."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your high school experience with me; it helps a lot. Now, could you tell me more about your further education after high school? What type of studies did you pursue at university?

User: "Although I don't recall specifics about my major or field of study, earning a university degree was an accomplishment that made me proud and prepared me for future endeavors. It was a challenging but rewarding experience that helped shape my skills and interests."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; I understand it can be difficult to recall specifics from a while back. Moving on, could you tell me about your work history? Have you had any previous jobs or employment experiences?

User: "I used to work as an administrative assistant for about five years. However, I had to leave my job due to some health issues related to my autism and other conditions. Unfortunately, I've been unemployed since then."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your work experience with me; it helps a lot. Now, could you tell me about any previous marriages or long-term relationships you've been in?
