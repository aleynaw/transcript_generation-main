Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to your employment history. Could you tell me a bit about your previous work experience?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that about your previous work history. Now, let's move on to discuss other aspects of your life. Could you tell me if you have any siblings?

User: Yes, I have one sibling. My brother Tomáš is younger than me and was born in 1985. He works as a teacher back in our hometown of Hartmanice.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that about your brother. Where does Tomáš live now, and what type of teaching does he do?

User: Tomáš still lives in our hometown of Hartmanice, where he works as a teacher. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what type of teaching he does, but I know he's passionate about his work and enjoys being back in our hometown.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your relaxation techniques with me. It's great that you've found ways to manage stress. Moving forward, I'd like to ask about any final thoughts or concerns you may have that we haven't discussed yet. Is there anything else you think is important for the doctor to know?

User: "I think it would be beneficial for Dr. Berg to understand that, despite my experiences with bipolar disorder, I'm capable of managing my condition and contributing positively to society. However, I do believe that occasional adjustments to my medication or therapy might be necessary to ensure the best possible outcomes."
