User: "Honestly, I've been thinking about getting back into carpentry or maybe even trying to find work as a handyman again. It's what I know and love doing with my hands. However, it's tough for me to adjust to new things due to my panic disorder, so we'll see what comes up."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Vahram. It sounds like carpentry or being a handyman is something you're passionate about. Let's move on to your medical history. Could you tell me about any current doctors you are seeing?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Vahram. I understand it can be a bit confusing. To clarify, by substance use, I mean how often do you consume things like cigarettes (nicotine), marijuana, or alcohol? If you're not sure or prefer not to answer, we can move on.

User: "I'd prefer not to answer that question. It's not something I've ever really thought about or discussed before."

User: "I don't think I've ever had any head injuries or concussions that I recall."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that. I'd like to ask about your history with rehab or substance counselling. Have you ever attended any rehabilitation programs or sought counselling for substance use?

User: "I don't think so... I've never had any issues with substances that I recall. My main struggles have been with anxiety and eating habits."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your honesty about your struggles. Let's move on to discuss other medical professionals you may have seen. Have you consulted or received treatment from any specialists, therapists, or other healthcare providers aside from your primary doctor?

User: "I'm not sure... I think I've only been seeing my primary doctor, Dr. Ryu Jeong-su, for my conditions."

Assistant: You're certain that Dr. Ryu Jeong-su is your primary doctor, but you seem unsure about seeing other specialists or therapists. Could you take a moment to think about it and see if you can recall any others?

User: "Now that you mention it... I think I did see a specialist after one of my panic attacks in 2010. It was at the hospital, and they had someone come talk to me about managing anxiety. Wait, it wasn't exactly a specialist... more like a counselor or therapist who came to the hospital room. And maybe another time as well, after my second hospitalization in 2018."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing those details with me. Could you tell me more about the counselor or therapist who came to see you at the hospital? For example, do you remember their name or what specific techniques they taught you to manage your anxiety?

User: "Well... I'm afraid I don't remember their name. It's been a while, and I was quite distressed at the time. But they did teach me some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises and visualization. They also gave me some general advice on managing stress and anxiety. I wish I could remember more about our conversations, but they were helpful in calming me down during those hospitalizations."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing those details with me. That's helpful to know, even if some specifics are hard to recall due to the circumstances. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any siblings in your immediate family?

User: "No, I don't have any siblings."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Moving on, could you tell me a bit about your early life? Where were you born?

User: I was born in Ararat, Armenia.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Since you were born outside of Canada, could you tell me the year you arrived in Canada?

User: "I'm not sure... I don’t really remember the exact year."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, let’s move on to discuss something else. Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: No, I am not a Canadian citizen.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. That helps clarify things. Now, could you tell me about any birth complications when you were born?

User: To be honest, I've never really thought about it or discussed it with anyone. So, I'm not sure if there were any birth complications when I was born.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. That helps clarify things about your birth. Now, could you tell me a bit about your early childhood development? For example, at a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

Let me know if this response meets the requirements!

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit about your high school experience? What was your average mark, and was there a particular topic or class that you enjoyed the most?

User: "I did pretty well in high school, to be honest. My average mark was good, and I enjoyed learning about various subjects, but if I had to pick one, I'd say I really liked reading Armenian literature."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your high school experiences. If you don't mind me asking, could you please specify what your average mark was in high school? Also, after high school, did you pursue any further education or studies?

User: "My average mark in high school was... well, it's not exactly specified, but I did do pretty well overall - my record shows I had a 'good' performance. As for further education after high school, I didn't actually pursue any."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your education. Now, I'd like to move on and ask: Could you tell me a bit about any previous work history or employment experiences you've had?

Assistant: Is there anything else you'd like to share that might be important for me to know?
