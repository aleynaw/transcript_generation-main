I apologize, I don't have this information readily available. I'd need to check my records or ask someone else for more details about Dr. Kwak Jinu's specialties."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received in the past?

User: "I've been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder. It's been a bit of a challenge for me, but I'm managing it with my current doctor's guidance and support. Knowing that there's also a family history of mental health conditions has made me more aware and cautious about my own well-being."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that, Gan. Now, I'd like to move on and discuss some aspects of your family history. Have you seen other medical professionals besides your primary doctor?

User: "I don't think so... at least, not recently. My mom has seen doctors for her depression, but as for me, I've just been seeing Dr. Kwak Jinu regularly."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Gan. Now, I'd like to ask about any family history of psychiatric conditions. Has anyone in your immediate family been diagnosed with a mental health condition?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Did your mother and paternal grandfather receive treatment or hospital care for their conditions?

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that you're unsure about some details. I appreciate your honesty, and this is helpful information for our assessment. Let's move on to another topic if you're ready. You mentioned earlier enjoying reading and playing guitar as hobbies. Could you expand a bit more on how these activities help you relax or express yourself creatively?

User: "Playing guitar helps me relax because it allows me to focus on the music and forget about my worries. When I'm reading, I get lost in the story or information, which takes my mind off things that might be stressing me out. Both activities also allow me to express myself creatively, whether it's through writing songs or imagining scenarios based on what I've read. It's almost like an escape from reality, you know? Sometimes, when I'm feeling overwhelmed, playing guitar or reading can help calm me down and give me a fresh perspective."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that you're unsure about some details. I appreciate your honesty, and this is helpful information for our assessment. Would you mind providing more information about your university studies, such as where you're studying and what type of degree you're pursuing?
