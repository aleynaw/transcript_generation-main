Assistant: Thank you for confirming that. Now, I'd like to discuss your birth and early childhood. Were there any complications during your birth?

User: "I don't recall any specific complications during my birth. At least, none were mentioned to me by my family members."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your birth. Let’s talk a bit more about your early childhood development. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I think I walked and talked at a relatively normal age, but as for developing friendships, it was probably a bit harder for me due to my autism spectrum disorder. I recall having difficulties interacting with peers when I was younger, which might have affected my social skills development."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like your autism spectrum disorder presented some challenges during your early childhood development. Let's move on now and talk about education. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school?

User: "I don't think I had significant difficulties in elementary school, but my performance was described as 'extending', which might indicate that I needed some extra support or accommodations."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Could you tell me a bit about your experience in high school? For example, what was your average mark, and did you have a favorite topic or class during that time?

User: "I recall that my high school performance was described as 'developing', but I don't have specific details about my average mark. As for favorite topics or classes, I'm not sure... I think I might have enjoyed art or music classes, but it's hard to remember specifically."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you try to think back and see if any specific details about your high school experience come to mind? For example, were there any subjects or classes that stood out to you, or perhaps any notable achievements?

Let's wait for the response before proceeding further in the interview.

User: "I'm trying to think back... it's been a while since high school. I don't have any specific memories of notable achievements or standout subjects. However, I do recall enjoying creative activities like painting and playing guitar, which might have influenced my interest in pursuing art-related topics later on."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about high school. I'd like to explore a bit more about your educational background now. Did you pursue any further education or studies after completing high school?

User: "Yes, I pursued further education after high school and completed a university degree. Unfortunately, I don't have specific details about my major or field of study readily available."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about high school. I'd like to explore a bit more about your educational background now. You mentioned that you pursued further education after completing high school and completed a university degree. Could you tell me a bit more about what type of studies you did, such as the field or major you focused on?

User: "I'm not sure... I don't have much recollection of the specifics regarding my university studies. Honestly, it's been a while since I graduated, and I haven't really thought about those details in a long time. If I had to guess, I'd say my interests at the time might have leaned towards art or design-related fields, given my hobbies."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about your university studies. I'd like to move on now to talk a bit more about your employment history. Can you tell me about any previous work experience you've had?

User: "I've had some previous work experience. I used to work part-time in sales at a retail store for about two years, and then I did freelance graphic design for a year before becoming unemployed."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your work history with me. That helps a lot. Now, I'd like to move on and discuss any previous marriages or long-term relationships. Could you tell me a bit about that?

User: I was in a long-term relationship for about four years, but it didn't work out due to compatibility issues.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your openness about your past relationship. Let's move on now and talk a bit more about what you enjoy doing in your free time. What are some of your favorite hobbies?

User: I enjoy doing creative activities in my free time, such as painting, playing guitar, and writing poetry.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. What do you usually do to relax on a stressful day?

User: "I usually try to relax by practicing meditation or listening to calming music like classical pieces. Sometimes, taking a long walk in nature also helps me unwind."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to move on and ask if there's anything else you think the doctor should know about your situation or any concerns you have?

User: "I'm not sure... I've tried to share everything that's been on my mind so far. One thing that might be worth mentioning is that I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with my current situation, being unemployed and struggling with my mental health. Sometimes it feels like there's a lot of pressure on me to get better or find a job, but I'm not sure what the right steps are... It's just really hard for me to think about right now."
