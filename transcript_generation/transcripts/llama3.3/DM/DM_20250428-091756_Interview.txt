Moving forward, I'd like to explore more about those academic challenges in elementary school. Can you elaborate a bit more on what specifically made things difficult for you during that time?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it's helpful to understand your experiences in elementary school. Moving forward, what was your average mark in high school, and did you have a favorite topic or class?

As for my favorite topic or class... hmm, I'm not really sure if I had one specific subject that stood out to me back then. I was more interested in extracurricular activities like playing guitar and photography."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Would you mind elaborating on your high school performance? Do you remember approximately how many credits you earned or if you had any notable achievements during that time?

(Note: We'll ask the next question related to further education after high school, but first, we need clarification on this topic.)

User: "I'm afraid I don't have exact numbers on my credits earned during high school... but I do know that I was considered proficient overall. Sorry, I'm not really sure about the exact number of credits or specific achievements... it's been a while since high school, and those details are a bit fuzzy."
