To be honest, I'm not entirely comfortable sharing more details about my current employment."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know about your health supplements. Could you please tell me a bit more about your frequency of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol use?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it takes a lot of courage to acknowledge those struggles. I want to assure you that everything discussed here is confidential and for your well-being. Let's move on to another topic if you're ready. Could you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received, and when they were diagnosed?

User: "I've been diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As for when it was diagnosed, I'm not entirely sure, but I think it was sometime during my teenage years. I've had some complications related to ADHD, which led to hospitalizations in the past."

User: "I've experienced some severe episodes of inattention and impulsivity, which led to accidents and injuries. As for hospitalizations, I think it was twice specifically due to ADHD-related complications. One of those times, I also had a minor surgery on my left ankle because of a sports injury."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your ADHD-related complications and hospitalizations. I'd like to move on to another topic now. Have you ever experienced any head injuries or concussions in the past?

User: "No, I have not experienced any head injuries or concussions in the past."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that. Could you tell me if you've ever had any seizures, and if so, when they started?

User: "I've had seizures in the past. To be honest, it's hard for me to remember exactly when they started... I'm not sure if it was during childhood or later on."

Assistant: Would you mind trying to estimate a rough timeline or age range when your seizures started, even if it's not an exact date?

User: "I think it might have been during my teenage years or early twenties... It's hard to pinpoint an exact time, but I remember having some episodes around that age range. It's not something I like to think about often, and my memory of those events is a bit fuzzy... But if I had to estimate, I'd say it was probably sometime between the ages of 15 and 22."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it's helpful to have an estimate. Let's move on to discuss your family history. Is there a history of psychiatric conditions in other family members?

User: "No, to the best of my knowledge, there is no history of psychiatric conditions in my family members."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit about any family history of neurological or genetic conditions?

Assistant: Thank you for confirming your citizenship. I'd like to ask about your early life now. Were there any birth complications that you're aware of?

User: "I'm not aware of any birth complications."

Assistant: That's helpful to know, thank you. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you could about your university experience. Now, let's move on to discussing your employment history. Have you had any previous work experiences that you'd be willing to share with me?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to move on to discussing your personal life a bit more, if that's okay with you. Have you ever been in any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's talk about your hobbies and lifestyle. What do you enjoy doing in your free time?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you have some effective strategies for managing stress. Moving on, I'd like to give you a chance to share anything else that might be important for us to know about your mental health or any concerns you have. Is there anything you think the doctor should be aware of that we haven't discussed yet?

User: "I think it's worth mentioning that I've experienced some traumatic events in the past and have also struggled with substance abuse. These experiences still affect me from time to time, and I'm not sure if they're related to my current ADHD symptoms or overall mental health situation. I'd appreciate any guidance on how these past experiences might be impacting my well-being."
