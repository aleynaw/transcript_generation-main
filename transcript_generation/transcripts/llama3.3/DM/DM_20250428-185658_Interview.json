Sometimes, when I'm feeling really stressed or overwhelmed, I find myself reverting back to old habits. It's something I'm actively working on in therapy, but it's still a struggle for me.\n\nAlso, given my family history of mental health conditions \u2013 my mom has schizophrenia, and my dad has post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 I sometimes worry about the potential risks for myself and how that might impact my treatment plan. I'd appreciate any guidance or reassurance you can offer on that front.\n\nLastly, I want to mention that I've been attending a substance abuse program at the British Columbia Addiction Centre, which has been really helpful in addressing some of my other struggles. However, I'm not sure if it's directly related to my mental health treatment, so I thought it was worth mentioning in case it's relevant.\n\nI hope that's helpful information for you and your team."
