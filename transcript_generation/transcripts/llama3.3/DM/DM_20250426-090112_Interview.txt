Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Let's move on. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I think I developed at my own pace as a child. Social situations were sometimes challenging for me, even back then. I don't really recall having many close friends when I was young, but that's not to say I didn't have any. It's just that I might have struggled a bit more than others in certain social situations."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your insights about your childhood. Let's move on to discuss your educational background. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school?

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. I understand that details can sometimes be hard to recall. Let's move on. Could you tell me a bit about your previous work history? Have you had any jobs or employment before, and if so, could you share some information about those experiences?

User: Yes, I have had previous work experiences. Before becoming a secondary school teacher, I worked part-time as a tutor for high school students. Additionally, I briefly worked as a librarian assistant during summer breaks.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you tell me a bit more about your work history? For instance, what were the names of the companies or institutions where you worked as a tutor and librarian assistant, and approximately how long did you work in each role?

User: "I'm afraid I don't recall the specific names of the companies or institutions where I worked as a tutor and librarian assistant. If you'd like, I can try to look into it further or provide more general details about my work experiences. However, please keep in mind that some details might be fuzzy due to the passage of time."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know about your work experiences. I understand that recalling specific details can sometimes be challenging. Moving on, could you tell me a bit about any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: "I'm currently in a long-term relationship. Prior to this, I was in a 2-year relationship that unfortunately ended due to emotional abuse. That experience was really tough for me... It's still a bit difficult for me to talk about the past relationship, but I'm trying to move forward."

Assistant: I appreciate your openness about this difficult topic. I'm here to listen and support you, not to push for details that make you uncomfortable. When you're ready, could you tell me a bit about your hobbies or activities you enjoy doing in your free time?
