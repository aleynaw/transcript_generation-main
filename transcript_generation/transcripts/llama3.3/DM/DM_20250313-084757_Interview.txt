User: "To be honest, I'm just not sure if I need to see anyone else right now because my treatment with Dr. Park Jihye has been going okay, and I haven't really thought about seeking additional help from other specialists or therapists. It's a bit overwhelming for me to think about adding more appointments and managing multiple healthcare professionals. But at the same time, if Dr. Park Jihye thinks it would be beneficial for my treatment, then I'd definitely consider it."

However, I do recall that my schizophrenia episodes led to hospitalizations at age 19 and again at age 21."
