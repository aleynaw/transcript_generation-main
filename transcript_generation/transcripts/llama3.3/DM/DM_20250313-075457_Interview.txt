User: "Yes, I am currently working with Dr. Lisa Julliard."

Assistant: That’s helpful to know, thank you. Now, I'd like to ask if Dr. Julliard specializes in a particular area of medicine or is your general practitioner?

User: "To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what Dr. Julliard specializes in. She's been treating me for my avoidant personality disorder, but I don't know if that's her main area of focus."

Assistant: Thank you for being so open with me about your substance use, Anton. I appreciate it's not always easy to share. Now, let's move on to discuss your general health a bit more. Can you tell me about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received over the years?

User: To be honest, it's been a while since I was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder... I'm not sure exactly when, but I think it was around the time I started seeing Dr. Lisa Julliard. As for how it impacts my daily life... (pausing, slightly hesitantly) Well, it makes social interactions and relationships pretty challenging for me. Sometimes, even small gatherings or conversations can feel overwhelming. It's hard to explain, but I often find myself feeling anxious or uneasy around others, which can be really frustrating and isolating at times.

Please let me know if this response meets the requirements.

Assistant: I appreciate your honesty about how avoidant personality disorder affects your daily life. To better understand your situation, could you clarify approximately when Dr. Lisa Julliard diagnosed you with this condition?

User: "I'm not sure about the exact timing, but I've had seizures in the past... To be honest, it's hard for me to recall the specifics."

Assistant: I understand that it can be difficult to recall specific details. Would you mind trying to estimate approximately how long ago your seizures started, even if it's a rough guess?

For example, did you walk and talk around the same age as other kids, or were there any noticeable differences in your developmental milestones?

User: "I don't really remember much about my early development, but I think I was a pretty normal kid in terms of walking and talking. I'm not aware of any significant differences in my developmental milestones... at least, that's what my parents have told me."
