Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Wei Jianguo’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on June 17 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Wei Jianguo to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: "It's just that talking about personal stuff can be kind of overwhelming for me...but if it will really help Dr. Wei Jianguo understand my situation better, then yeah, I'm okay with spending some time answering your questions."

Assistant: Thank you for your openness about feeling overwhelmed. It's completely understandable, and I appreciate your willingness to participate in this process to help Dr. Wei Jianguo better understand your situation. Let's take things at a comfortable pace. To begin, could you tell me your full name?

User: "My full name is Etela Salajova."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your full name with me, Etela. Now, could you tell me what name you prefer to be called?

User: "I'm fine with either Etela or Etie, but most people just call me Etela."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know your preferred name, Etela. To move forward, could you please tell me your date of birth?

User: My date of birth is March 23, 2006.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your date of birth with me, Etela. Could you tell me what sex you identify with?

User: "I identify as female."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. Now, I'd like to know which hand do you prefer using or feel more comfortable with? Are you left-handed, right-handed, or do you use both hands equally?

User: "I'm right-handed."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know your handedness preference. Moving forward, I'd like to discuss some information about where you currently reside. Could you tell me what city or town you live in?

User: "I currently live in West Kara, British Columbia."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know your handedness preference, Etela. Now, I'd like to move on to some information about where you currently reside and a bit about your personal life. Could you tell me if you're single, in a relationship, married, or in a common-law partnership?

User: "I'm not in a relationship or married, so yeah, I'm single."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any children or dependents?

User: "No, I don't have any children."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that. Let's move on to discuss your work situation. Are you currently working?

User: "Yes, I am currently working as an investment banker, but I'm also focusing on my studies full-time. To be honest, it's been a bit of a balancing act for me."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. That does sound like a challenging balancing act. Could you tell me a bit more about your job as an investment banker? For example, what is the name of the company you work for and how long have you been working there?

User: "Uh, I'm not really sure if I should be sharing this information, but... I work for an investment banking firm, and to be honest, I don't really remember the company name right now. It's a bit embarrassing. But I think it's been about a year or so since I started working there part-time. My role is operational, which means I do more behind-the-scenes work."

Assistant: Would you mind elaborating a bit more on that? Specifically, what makes you uncomfortable sharing the company name, and do you think it might be possible to recall the name or look it up later if needed?

User: "Honestly, I'm not really sure why I feel uncomfortable sharing the company name... I think it might be because I've had some issues with anxiety in the past, and sometimes I just get nervous about sharing certain details. As for recalling or looking up the name later, I suppose it's possible... but to be honest, I'd rather not think about it too much right now."

Assistant: Thank you for being open with me, Etela. I understand it can be uncomfortable sharing certain details. Let's move on to something else. Are you currently receiving any disability assistance?

User: "I don’t think so... I mean, I’m not disabled or anything, but I do get some health supplements and medications through my doctor. Does that count? Or are you asking about something else?"

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. To clarify, disability assistance might include benefits or support provided due to a medical condition or impairment. In your case, it sounds like you're receiving some health-related support through your doctor, which is great. Just to confirm, are there any specific health conditions you're managing right now for which you receive this support?

User: "Yes, I have ADHD and avoidant personality disorder. I receive medication and supplements to help manage my conditions."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I'd like to move on and ask about your medical care. Could you tell me a bit more about your current doctors? Who they are and how long you've been seeing them?

User: "I'm currently seeing Dr. Mushegh Tugremenjian, but to be honest, I don't really remember how long I've been seeing him. I think it's been a while, though - at least since my anxiety issues started getting more severe."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I'd like to move on to discuss your allergies. Are there any specific medications or substances you're allergic to?

User: "Honestly, I'm not really aware of having any specific allergies... but I do take some medications like Adderall and Zoloft for my ADHD and avoidant personality disorder. If there are any concerns, I'd be happy to discuss it with my doctor."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I appreciate your openness about your medical conditions and treatments. Could you tell me a bit more about your current medications? For example, what is your current dosage of Adderall and Zoloft, and how often do you take them?

User: "I take Adderall and Zoloft for my ADHD and avoidant personality disorder. The dosage of Adderall is between 5-40 mg per day, divided into multiple doses. For Zoloft, it's between 50-200 mg per day."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I'd like to move on and ask about your health supplements. Are you currently taking any vitamins or other dietary supplements?

User: "Yes, I currently take vitamin D and melatonin as dietary supplements."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. Now, could you tell me about your use of nicotine, marijuana, and alcohol? For example, how frequently do you consume these substances, if at all?

User: "I'm not really sure... I don't think I've ever been asked about this before. To be honest, I don't consume nicotine or marijuana at all, but I may have had a small amount of alcohol on rare occasions with family or friends."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your substance use, Etela; it helps a lot in understanding your overall health picture. Now, I'd like to ask about your general health conditions or any diagnoses you've received over time. Have you been diagnosed with any specific health conditions?

User: "Yes, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and avoidant personality disorder. My doctor has prescribed me medications to manage these conditions."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I appreciate your openness about your health conditions and treatments. Now, let's move on to discuss any previous hospitalizations or surgeries you may have had. Have there been any instances where you were hospitalized due to a medical condition or accident?

User: "Yes, I have been hospitalized in the past due to medical conditions and accidents. Specifically, I was hospitalized twice for severe anxiety attacks and once for an appendectomy when I was 15 years old."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your hospitalizations, Etela. I'd like to move on and discuss some neurological aspects of your health. Have you ever experienced a head injury or concussion?

User: "Yes, I have experienced a head injury or concussion in the past. It happened when I was 12 years old; I fell off my bike and got a concussion. It led to some short-term memory problems that resolved on their own."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it helps a lot. Now, if I could clarify further regarding the concussion when you were 12 years old, did you receive any professional medical treatment for the injury at the time?

User: "I don't think so... I mean, my parents took care of me at home, but I'm not sure if I saw a doctor specifically for the concussion. To be honest, it was a while ago, and I don't really remember all the details about my treatment after the accident."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I understand it can be difficult to remember details from a while back. Let's move on and discuss something else. Have you ever experienced any seizures or conditions that may have led to seizure-like episodes?

User: "I don't think so... I mean, according to what I know about my medical history, I've never had any seizures or conditions that may have led to seizure-like episodes. I'm pretty sure about that, but if there's something in my medical records that I'm not aware of, I'd like to know."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela; it helps a lot. Now, if I could switch topics slightly, I'd like to discuss your family history a bit more. Specifically, have there been any psychiatric conditions or mental health issues within your immediate or extended family?

User: "I don't think so... my parents and siblings are all pretty healthy, mentally speaking. At least, nothing serious has ever been mentioned to me."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know about your family's mental health. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to ask some more specific questions about your siblings. Do you have any siblings?

User: No, I don't have any siblings.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. I'd like to ask a bit more about your early life and background now. Where were you born?

User: "I was born in Kunerad, Slovakia."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. Since you were born outside of Canada, could you tell me what year you arrived in Canada?

User: "I’m not really sure about the exact year I arrived in Canada. I know I was born in Slovakia, but I’ve been living here for a while now. If it’s important, maybe we can check my medical records or something?"

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Etela. Checking your medical records might be a good idea to confirm that information later on. Moving forward, could you tell me if you are a Canadian citizen?

User: "Yes, I am a Canadian citizen."

Assistant: Thank you for confirming that with me. Moving on, were there any complications during your birth that you're aware of?

User: Honestly, I don't think so... I mean, I'm not aware of any complications during my birth. My parents never mentioned anything like that to me, and I've never had any issues that would make me think there were problems.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Etela. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids typically do?

User: "I'm pretty sure I developed normally, but I don't have any specific memories that stand out to me."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about your early development, Etela. Now, could you tell me a bit about your educational background? Were there any difficulties you faced in elementary school?

User: "I didn't really face any difficulties in elementary school. My performance was actually pretty good."

Assistant: That's helpful to know, Etela. What was your average mark in high school, and did you have a favorite topic or class during that time?

User: "I don't really remember my exact average mark, but like I said before, my performance was pretty good. As for favorite topics or classes, I did enjoy learning new things, but nothing specifically stood out to me."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts about high school with me, Etela. Did you pursue any further education after completing high school?

User: Yes, I am currently pursuing a university degree.

Assistant: Could you tell me more about your university studies, such as where you're studying and what type of degree you're pursuing?

User: "I was born in Kunerad, Slovakia, and as far as I know, there were no complications during my birth. I don't have any information about any birth complications, so I'm assuming everything went smoothly."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you tell me if you're a Canadian citizen?

Assistant: I understand that you're unsure about the exact year. Could you perhaps give me an approximate time frame or decade when you arrived in Canada? This might help us better understand your background.

User: "I'm not really sure about the exact time frame or decade when I arrived in Canada. To be honest, I've never really thought about it that much."

Assistant: That's okay, Etela. Thank you for letting me know that you're unsure about your arrival year in Canada. Now, could you tell me a bit about your early development? At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "To be honest, I'm not really sure about specifics like when I started walking or talking. I was a pretty normal kid as far as I know, but I don't have many memories from back then. One thing I do remember is having some trouble with short-term memory after a concussion when I was 12, which might be related to my ADHD diagnosis later on."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you can remember about your early development, Etela. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a bit more about any difficulties you experienced in elementary school? Were there any subjects or activities that you found particularly challenging?
