Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

As for symptoms or impacts, I haven't noticed anything significant since then. My doctor told me that there were no lasting cognitive effects, so I've been lucky in that regard."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Emma. Now, I'd like to discuss your history of seizures. Have you ever experienced any seizures or been diagnosed with a seizure disorder?

User: "I don't think I've ever had seizures... but I did have a concussion many years ago, so I'm pretty sure I would remember if I'd had any seizures."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to ask about your history of rehab or substance counselling. Have you ever participated in any rehabilitation programs or received counseling for substance use?

User: "No, I haven't participated in any rehabilitation programs or received counseling for substance use. To be honest, I've only occasionally had beer on social occasions, so I don't think I've ever had a problem with substance use that would require rehab or counselling."
