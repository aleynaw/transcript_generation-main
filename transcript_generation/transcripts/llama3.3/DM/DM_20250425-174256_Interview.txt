User: "I wouldn't say I had an outstanding experience in high school. My performance was more of a work-in-progress, and I didn't really have a favorite topic or class that stands out to me. I did manage to get by, but it wasn't exactly an easy time for me academically or socially."

Assistant: I understand that you're unsure about some details, and that's okay. Would you mind telling me more about what you mean by a "general program"? Was it related to any specific field or industry?

User: "I think what I meant by 'general program' is that it wasn't extremely specialized in one area. However, looking back, I believe it did lay some groundwork for my future career in finance and accounting, which eventually led me to become an accountant."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you can remember about your further education; I understand that not all details are clear.
