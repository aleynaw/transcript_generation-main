Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Moving forward, what was your average mark in high school? Was there a particular topic or class that stood out to you as a favorite during that time?

User: "I was considered proficient in high school. As for my average mark, I don't have that information readily available. I remember enjoying social experiences and interacting with friends during that time, but I don't recall having a particular favorite topic or class."
