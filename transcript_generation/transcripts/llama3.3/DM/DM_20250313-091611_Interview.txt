User: "I don't think so... wait, actually, I may have had some counseling sessions related to my eating disorder, but I'm not really sure if that counts as rehab. To be honest, it's all a bit fuzzy in my memory."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information, even though it's a bit unclear. Could you try to remember any specific details about those counseling sessions for your eating disorder? For instance, where did they take place and roughly when were they?

User: "I'm trying to remember... I think it was during my therapy sessions with Dr. Vlado Beletic, my current doctor. As for when, I'm not sure, but I believe it started around the time I began taking medication for my binge-eating disorder. It's hard for me to remember exact dates and times... I'm sorry, it's just a bit fuzzy in my memory. But I do recall that those therapy sessions helped me talk through some of my struggles with binge eating."

User: "I'm not really sure if I'd like to share that information right now; it's a bit personal for me to discuss my education in detail."

Assistant: I completely understand your reservation in sharing more about your education right now. It's perfectly fine to keep some details private if you're not comfortable discussing them. Thank you for being honest with me about that. Moving on, could you tell me a bit about your previous work history? Have you had any jobs or employment experiences that might be relevant to our discussion today?

User: "I've worked as a teaching assistant for two years before becoming a primary school teacher. I'm not sure how relevant this experience is to our discussion today, but I'm happy to share more if you think it might be helpful."

Assistant: Thank you for being honest with me about your reservation in sharing more details. I completely understand, and we can move on to other topics. You've shared that you worked as a teaching assistant and then became a primary school teacher. Can you tell me a bit more about these roles? Specifically, what companies or schools did you work at and for how many years?
