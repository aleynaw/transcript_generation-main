That's very helpful information, and I appreciate you being so open about your medical history. It's great that you're working with Dr. Zhang on managing these conditions.

I'd like to explore a bit more about your family history related to mental health. Have there been any psychiatric conditions in other family members? For example, do you have parents or siblings who have experienced similar challenges? If so, did they receive treatment or hospital care for their condition?

Please feel free to share as much or as little information as you're comfortable with regarding your family's experiences with mental health.
