I did well in school, starting from elementary school where my performance was 'On Track', and continuing into high school where I was 'Proficient'. I'm assuming that means I walked, talked, and developed friendships like other kids typically do, but I don't have any specific memories to confirm that."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information with me. I'd like to move on and talk about your work history outside of research roles. Could you tell me a bit about any previous work experiences, such as jobs or careers, before or after your role at the University of British Columbia?

User: "I've had two main work experiences outside of research roles. Before my role at the University of British Columbia, I don't have much information about other jobs or careers. However, after leaving the university in 2005, I worked as a microbiologist at a private lab in Richmond, BC, until 2020."

Assistant: Would you mind taking some time to think about your education after high school? Sometimes, details can come back to us later. If it’s okay with you, I'd like to ask again in the future if more information becomes available to you. Now, let's move on and discuss another topic. Where were you born?

User: "I was born in Josephhaven, Canada."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to ask if you were born outside of Canada, but since you mentioned Josephhaven, which is in Canada, we can move on. Are there any birth complications or concerns from your early life that you're aware of?

User: "I don't think there were any significant birth complications or concerns that I'm aware of from my early life."

User: "I'm not sure about my education after high school, but I do know that I worked as a research assistant at the University of British Columbia from 1995 to 2005."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; I appreciate your honesty about having limited information on some aspects. Let’s move on and explore another topic. You mentioned earlier that you don't have any siblings. Can you tell me a bit about your previous work history before working as a research assistant at the University of British Columbia from 1995 to 2005, or if applicable, after leaving UBC in 2005?

User: "I don't have much information about my previous work history before working as a research assistant at the University of British Columbia from 1995 to 2005. However, after leaving UBC in 2005, I worked as a microbiologist at a private lab in Richmond, BC, until 2020."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information. You've already mentioned your work experience at a private lab after leaving UBC in 2005. Let's move on and explore another topic. Can you tell me about any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: "I've been in a long-term relationship with my partner since 2012, but we haven't gotten married yet. It's just something that hasn't felt necessary for us."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information with me. Now, let's move on and discuss your hobbies and lifestyle. Could you tell me a bit more about what you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: "To relax on a stressful day, I practice yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises. These activities help me manage my stress and anxiety."

In addition to these activities, are there any other hobbies or things you enjoy doing when you're not working?

User: No, those are the main things I enjoy doing in my free time.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your hobbies and lifestyle with me. I'd like to move on now to our final topic. Is there anything else you think the doctor needs to know about your mental health or any other aspect of your life that we haven't discussed yet?

User: "I think it would be helpful for the doctor to know that living with OCD can sometimes make everyday tasks feel overwhelming, even when I'm managing my symptoms well. It's essential for me to maintain my routines and find healthy coping mechanisms, like yoga and deep breathing exercises, to keep my anxiety in check."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing all this valuable information with me. It's been helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of your experiences and challenges. If there's anything else that comes to mind later, please don't hesitate to share it with the doctor during your appointment. Have a great day! <STOP>
