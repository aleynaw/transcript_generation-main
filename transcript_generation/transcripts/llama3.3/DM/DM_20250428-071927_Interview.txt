User: "Growing up, these delays made it challenging for me to keep up with my peers in school. I often struggled to understand and complete assignments on time. As an adult, these challenges persist, making everyday tasks more difficult than they need to be. Simple things like managing finances or planning appointments can become overwhelming due to my cognitive processing issues."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit about your early educational experiences? Were there any difficulties or notable events in elementary school that come to mind?

User: "Yes, I did face some challenges in elementary school. My performance was considered 'Emerging', which meant I needed extra support to keep up with my peers. It was a bit of a struggle, but I managed to get by with some help. Looking back, it's clear that those early difficulties were just the beginning of my ongoing cognitive processing challenges."

User: "I previously worked as a data entry clerk for about 5 years, but I don't recall the exact company name or dates of employment. Unfortunately, I had to leave my job due to my disability."
