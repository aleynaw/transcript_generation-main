Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Marijana Griesser-Zeilinger’s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on January 20 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Marijana Griesser-Zeilinger to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, I guess so... I mean, if it's going to help Dr. Griesser-Zeilinger understand me better, then sure. It's just that I'm not really used to talking about myself, you know?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your openness, even if it can be challenging to discuss these topics. Let's move on to some more general information. Could you tell me a bit about yourself? Starting with something simple, what is your full name?

User: "I'm Mr. Daniel McVeigh, nice to meet you. My friends call me Dan, by the way."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, if you don't mind, could you tell me your date of birth?

User: My date of birth is September 06, 1996.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, could you tell me your sex?

User: "Ah, yeah... My sex is female. It's kinda weird because people usually think I'm a guy due to my name, but nope, I'm a girl."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about that. Could you tell me your handedness – do you consider yourself left-handed, right-handed, or both?

User: "I'm right-handed."

Assistant: <STOP>
