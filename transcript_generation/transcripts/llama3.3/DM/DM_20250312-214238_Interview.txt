Also, I should mention that I have a history of seizures... but it's been a while since the last episode occurred."

Could you share more about your seizure history if you're comfortable discussing it?

User: "It's hard for me to talk about this, but... (pauses) To be honest, I don't really remember much about it. It's not something I like to think about. Can we move on to something else?"

Assistant: That's helpful to know you stay busy, but I'd like to understand what specific activities help you relax and enjoy your free time. What do you do on a stressful day to unwind?

User: "I usually try to listen to some calming music or take a short walk outside to clear my head."

User: I was born in Gwacheon-si, South Korea.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your birthplace with me. If you were born outside of Canada, what year did you arrive in Canada?

User: "I'm not entirely sure, but I think it was around 2018 or sometime after that."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Would you mind trying to think of any specific details or events around your move to Canada that might help narrow down the exact year?

User: "I think it was around 2018 because I remember leaving my job as an English teacher in Busan and moving to Canada shortly after. I'm pretty sure it was that year because I started working as a laborer for a construction company in Vancouver soon after arriving, but I'd have to check some old documents to confirm the exact date."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that detailed information. It's helpful in getting a clearer picture of your background. Now, let's move on to another topic. Are you a Canadian citizen?
