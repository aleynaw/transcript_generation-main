Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Stephane. Now, could you tell me which hand you prefer to use when performing daily tasks, such as writing or throwing a ball?

User: "I'm ambidextrous, so I don't really have a preference between left and right hands. I find that I can use both hands equally well for most tasks, so it doesn't make a big difference to me which hand I use."

User: No, I am not receiving any kind of disability assistance.

Assistant: Could you tell me about your current doctors? For example, who is your primary care physician?

User: My current doctor is Dr. Ya-Wen Chang.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Are there any other doctors or specialists you regularly see aside from Dr. Chang? Additionally, do you take any medications currently, and if so, what are they and in what dosages?

User: "I don't see any other doctors regularly aside from Dr. Chang. As for medications, I take small white oval-shaped pills."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to clarify a bit more about your medications. You mentioned taking small white oval-shaped pills, but could you tell me what they're for and the exact dosage you've been prescribed?

User: The small white oval-shaped pills are for managing symptoms related to my panic disorder and autism spectrum disorder. As for the dosage, it's within the range of 2 to 15 milligrams per day.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information. Could you provide more specifics on your dosage schedule—how often do you take these pills? Also, aside from the medication you've mentioned, are there any health supplements you're currently taking or have taken in the past?

User: "Yes, I take my medication once a day, in the morning. As for health supplements, aside from the small white oval-shaped pills (Aripiprazole), I also take fish oil supplements and sports nutrition supplements to support my overall health and well-being. I'm not sure if it's relevant, but I try to maintain a consistent schedule with my medication and supplements to help manage my symptoms."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on to discuss your allergies. Are there any known allergies we should be aware of?

User: "To be honest, I don't think I have any known allergies. At least, none that I've been made aware of or have experienced any issues with in the past."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever had any significant health conditions or diagnoses?

User: "I have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and panic disorder. These conditions have had a significant impact on my life, and I've even been hospitalized in the past due to severe anxiety attacks and panic episodes. Specifically, I was hospitalized at age 15 for a week and again at age 17 for three days."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to ask about your experiences with previous hospitalizations and surgeries. Could you describe how these events have impacted your daily life, including any lasting effects or changes you've noticed in yourself?

User: "I've noticed that after those hospitalizations, I became more withdrawn and anxious in social situations. It took me some time to adjust back to school and interact with friends. However, I've also learned coping mechanisms like listening to classical music, taking long walks, and doing yoga to manage my anxiety. I'd say it's been a gradual process of learning to deal with these conditions, but it's not something I've completely overcome. Some days are still harder than others."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing how these events have impacted your daily life. Now, I'd like to ask about any head injuries or concussions you may have experienced. Have you ever had a head injury or concussion?

User: "No, I have not had any head injuries or concussions."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, have you ever experienced any seizures?

User: "No, I don't think so. At least, none that I can remember or that have been diagnosed by a doctor."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to ask about any experiences with rehabilitation or substance counseling programs. Have you ever participated in rehab or received substance counseling?

User: "I have had some struggles with substance abuse in the past, and I'm not proud of it. It's been a challenging experience for me to overcome."

Assistant: Thank you for being open with me about your struggles. Could you expand on that for me? Did you receive any professional help or counseling to overcome these challenges, and if so, where did you seek help and when was this?

User: "I did receive some help from professionals. I was hospitalized twice, once when I was 15 and again when I was 17. During those times, I received counseling to deal with my anxiety and panic attacks. However, I'm not sure if it specifically addressed my substance abuse issues. It's been a bit of a blur for me, but I remember feeling overwhelmed during those times, and I was grateful to have some support from professionals."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it helps to understand your journey better. Let's move on a bit. Have you seen any other medical professionals aside from those you've mentioned, perhaps specialists or general practitioners, at any point in your life?

User: "I have seen Dr. Ya-Wen Chang regularly for my condition. Additionally, I've had interactions with other medical professionals during my hospital stays."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to another topic if you're ready. Regarding your family history, are there any instances of psychiatric conditions among your relatives?

User: Yes, I am a Canadian citizen.

Assistant: Thank you for confirming that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit about any birth complications you may have experienced?

User: "I don't think I've experienced any significant birth complications."

Assistant: That's helpful to know, thank you. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I... um... I think I developed a bit differently than other kids. I have autism, so I had some challenges with social interactions and communication when I was younger. I'm not sure if I walked or talked at the same time as other kids, but I do know that I had some difficulties with social interactions and making friends when I was younger."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me; it helps a lot to understand your perspective better. Now, moving forward, could you tell me about any difficulties you experienced in elementary school?

User: "I don't think I experienced any major difficulties in elementary school. According to my records, my performance was on track."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Moving forward, could you tell me a bit about your high school experience? Were there any subjects or classes that you particularly enjoyed or excelled in?

User: "I was proficient in my high school studies, and I think I enjoyed classes related to history and literature. I'm not sure if I excelled in any particular subject, but those areas interested me the most."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you elaborate a bit more on your performance in high school? For example, what was your average mark? Were there any specific topics or classes within history and literature that stood out to you as favorites?

User: I don't have specific information about my average mark, but I do know that I was proficient in my high school studies. As for history and literature, I generally enjoyed learning about different time periods and reading historical fiction novels.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, moving on to your education after high school, did you pursue any further studies? If yes, could you tell me where and what type of studies you engaged in?

User: "I am currently pursuing a post-secondary certificate or diploma."

Assistant: That's great, thank you for sharing that. Could you expand a bit more on your current studies? Specifically, where are you pursuing this post-secondary certificate or diploma, and what type of program is it (e.g., vocational training, academic degree)?

User: I'm currently pursuing a post-secondary certificate or diploma, but I'd rather not specify where due to personal reasons.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing as much as you're comfortable about your current studies. Let's move on to a different area. Could you tell me a bit about your siblings? For example, do you have any brothers or sisters, and if so, what are their ages?

User: I have one sibling, a younger sister named Colette. She's currently 14 years old.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know about your sister Colette. To clarify further, does she live with you or elsewhere? Additionally, moving forward, could you tell me a bit about where you were born and whether there were any birth complications that are known to you or have affected you in some way?

User: "I live with my family, so yes, my sister Colette lives with me. As for where I was born, it's Haileyville, Canada. I don't think there were any birth complications that are known to me or have affected me in some way."

Assistant: That's helpful to know. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit about your early development? For example, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships at a typical age like other kids, or were there any noticeable differences in your developmental milestones?

User: "I was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which has likely impacted some aspects of my developmental milestones. In terms of specific differences, I'm not really sure - I'd have to think about it for a bit. However, I do know that my Elementary School Performance was on track and my High School Performance was proficient. I don't recall any major issues with walking or talking at typical ages, but social interactions were definitely more challenging for me than for some of my peers."

Assistant: That's helpful to know, thank you for sharing about your developmental milestones. To move forward, I'd like to discuss your educational background in more detail. You mentioned earlier that you had difficulties during elementary school. Could you expand a bit more on what those challenges were and how they affected your learning?

User: "It's hard for me to remember specifics about elementary school, but I do know that social interactions were more challenging for me than for some of my peers due to my autism spectrum disorder."

Assistant: Thank you for being open with me about those challenges. It can't have been easy to navigate. Moving forward, could you tell me a bit more about your high school experience? What was your average mark in high school, and were there any particular topics or classes that you enjoyed or found especially engaging?

User: My high school experience was generally positive since my High School Performance was proficient. However, I'm not really sure about my average marks - I'd have to think about it for a bit or maybe look up some old records. Unfortunately, there aren't any particular topics or classes that immediately come to mind as especially enjoyable or engaging.
