Assistant: I understand that it can be hard to pinpoint an exact time, but any information you can provide about your diagnosis timeline would be helpful. If not a specific date, perhaps a rough estimate of when you started noticing symptoms or when the diagnosis was made?

User: "To be honest, I've been struggling with symptoms for as long as I can remember. I think it was sometime after my kids were born that I started noticing significant mood swings and struggles with energy levels. But the exact timing of when I was diagnosed is a bit fuzzy to me."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I think I developed normally... I mean, I don't remember having any major issues with walking or talking as a kid. And I did have friends in school, although I was a bit shy at times."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's talk about your education background. Were there any difficulties you faced in elementary school?

User: I don't think I faced any major difficulties in elementary school. My performance was described as "Extending", which suggests that I was doing well academically.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, moving forward to your high school experience, could you tell me about your average mark and favorite topic or class during that time?

User: My high school performance was described as 'Emerging'. I don't recall my exact average mark, but I think it was decent. As for my favorite topic or class, I'm not really sure... I mean, I didn't have any particular favorite subject that stands out in my mind.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that about your high school experience. Did you pursue further education after high school?

User: "No, I didn't pursue further education after high school. To be honest, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do at that point in my life, so I just started working as a research assistant at a university and figured things out from there."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit more about your previous work history? What companies have you worked for and how long were you there?

User: "I worked as a research assistant at a university for about 3 years, and then I moved on to become a research officer in the government. That's been my main work experience so far."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit about any previous marriages or long-term relationships?

User: "I'm currently married, and before this marriage, I had another long-term relationship that lasted until 2015. My current husband and I have been together for a while now, but before him, I had another serious relationship that ended about 7 years ago."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to discuss some lighter topics now. What kind of activities or hobbies do you enjoy in your free time?

User: "I really enjoy reading fiction novels, it helps me escape reality for a bit. I'm also quite into yoga, it keeps me grounded and focused. And when I have some extra time, I love to cook traditional Indian dishes, it reminds me of my childhood."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your hobbies with me. Now, I'd like to discuss what you do to relax when you're having a particularly stressful day. What activities or practices help calm you down during those times?

User: "When I'm stressed, I find listening to classical music really calming. Sometimes, taking short walks outside helps me clear my head too. And if all else fails, practicing some deep breathing exercises usually does the trick."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your relaxation techniques with me; it’s helpful to know how you manage stress. Let’s move forward to something else now. You mentioned earlier about having siblings but didn’t get a chance to expand on them due to our conversation flow. Could you tell me more about each of your siblings, like their names, ages, where they live, and what they do?

User: "I have one sibling, a younger sister who is 25 years old and lives in Vancouver. She works as an accountant there."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing more about your sister. I'd like to move on to discussing your personal history a bit further. Could you tell me anything else that might be relevant or important for understanding your background and current situation?

User: "I've experienced some traumatic events in my past, which I'm still trying to work through. I also struggled with substance abuse, but I attended a rehab program and have been working on recovery since then."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about those experiences; it's not always easy to share. I'd like to understand how these events have impacted your daily life now. Can you describe any ways in which they influence your thoughts, feelings, or behaviors on a day-to-day basis?

User: "Well, I think my past experiences still affect me in some ways. Sometimes, I get anxious or depressed without any reason, and it takes me some time to calm down. But I'm working on managing those feelings with therapy and medication. My substance abuse is under control now, thanks to the rehab program. It's still a bit of a struggle, but I'm getting better at recognizing my triggers and dealing with them in healthier ways."

Assistant: Thank you for being so open with me about these personal experiences; it helps a lot in understanding your background. Is there anything else that you think the doctor needs to know or any final thoughts you'd like to share before we conclude our discussion today?

User: "Actually, I think it's been helpful discussing all these aspects with you. One thing that might be useful to know is how my family, especially my husband and children, have been very supportive throughout this journey. They help me stay grounded when things get tough."
