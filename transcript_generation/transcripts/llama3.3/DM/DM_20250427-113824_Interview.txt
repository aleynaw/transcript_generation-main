User: "Yes, I enjoy doing various things in my free time to help me unwind and relax. I find solace in reading books, especially those that allow me to escape into different worlds. Hiking is another activity that helps me clear my mind and connect with nature. I also appreciate creating art through painting and playing the guitar, as it allows me to express myself creatively. Additionally, I practice meditation, deep breathing exercises, and listen to classical music to calm my mind and soothe my anxiety."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that about your previous long-term relationship. Now, I'd like to talk a bit more about what you do to relax on stressful days. You mentioned earlier enjoying reading books and hiking. What specifically do you find relaxing or enjoyable when engaging in these activities?

User: "I think what I find most enjoyable about reading is getting lost in different worlds and stories. It helps me escape from reality for a bit and clear my mind. As for hiking, being out in nature has always been calming for me. There's something about breathing fresh air and listening to the sounds of birds chirping that just soothes my anxiety."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's move on to the final part of our conversation. Is there anything else that you think the doctor needs to know about your mental health history or current experiences?

User: "Actually, yes. I think it's worth mentioning that I've struggled with anxiety and depression in the past, particularly during my long-term relationship from 2017 to 2020. While I'm currently taking medication for avoidant personality disorder and social anxiety disorder, I sometimes worry about relapsing into old patterns or struggling with new challenges as a nursing student. However, I'm working hard to maintain my mental health through self-care activities like meditation, deep breathing exercises, and creative pursuits."
