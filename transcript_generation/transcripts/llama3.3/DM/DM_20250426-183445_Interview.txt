I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Lori Hebert to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: "Uh, yeah... I think so. It might take me a little while to open up about my personal stuff, but if it helps Dr. Hebert understand what's going on with me, then I'm willing to try."

Let's move forward by starting with some general information about yourself. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: I live in South Frederickton, British Columbia, Canada.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. Could you please tell me about your current marital status? Are you single, in a relationship, married, or common law?

User: "I'm single. I do have a child, though - my son is six years old."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. Since you mentioned your son, I would like to clarify: Are there any other children or dependents in your care?

User: "No, there is only one child in my care - my 6-year-old son Lucas."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know about your son. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your employment and financial situation. Could you please tell me if you are currently working?

User: "I'm currently not working. I used to work part-time in retail, but I had to leave my job because of my health issues. I've been unemployed for a while now due to my health conditions. It's been tough for me to find a new job that accommodates my needs."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. I understand it can be challenging to find suitable employment due to health conditions. If you don't mind telling me, could you share if you receive any disability assistance?

User: No, I don't receive any disability assistance.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. Now, let's move on to discuss your medical history. Could you please tell me about your current doctors?

User: "I'm not sure if I have all the names written down, but I do see a doctor regularly for my ADHD and avoidant personality disorder. I think I have a psychiatrist and maybe a GP, but I'd need to check my records to confirm."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Would you mind elaborating a bit more on your current doctors? Perhaps we could discuss the names or specialties of the doctors you're seeing regularly, even if you need a moment to recall them from your records?

User: "I'm not sure if I have all the information readily available... (pauses) ...but I think I see a psychiatrist for my ADHD and avoidant personality disorder. I'd need to check my records to confirm their names and specialties."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Angela. I appreciate your honesty about needing to verify some information from your records. Let's move forward for now. Could you tell me if you have any known allergies?

User: "Yes, I have allergies to paracetamol and pollen."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. I'd like to discuss your current medications and dosage now. Could you please tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including their names and dosages?

User: "I take two types of medications regularly. One is a small, blue pill that I take once a day, and the other is a white, oval-shaped pill that I take twice a day in divided doses. If I remember correctly, the dosage for the blue pill is around 10-20 mg, and the white pill is around 20-60 mg per day."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. Could you clarify or find out more specific details about the names of these medications? Additionally, do you take any health supplements regularly?

User: "Ah, let me check my records... (pauses) ...yes, I take Paroxetine and Methylphenidate regularly. As for health supplements, I do take probiotics, vitamin D, and calcium to help with my overall well-being."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. That's helpful information. Let’s move on now. Could you tell me about your usage of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol? Do you use any of these substances regularly, and if so, how often?

User: "To be honest, it's been a bit of a struggle for me... but I do occasionally drink wine as a way to relax and unwind. However, I've noticed that sometimes my consumption can get out of hand, which is why I've attended those support groups in the past. It's not something I'm proud of, but I'm working on it."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Angela. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and work on personal struggles like that. Now, let's move forward. Could you describe your health conditions or diagnoses in more detail? For example, when were you diagnosed with ADHD and avoidant personality disorder?

User: "I'm not sure about the exact timing of when I was diagnosed with ADHD, but I've had symptoms since I was a kid... um, I think it was around 8 or 9 years old? As for Avoidant Personality Disorder, I don't really remember when I got diagnosed with that one either... but it's been a few years now, and I've been trying to work through it with therapy."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information, Angela. I understand it can be challenging to recall specific dates. Would you mind trying to find out or estimate when you were diagnosed with ADHD and avoidant personality disorder? If not, we can move on to the next topic.

User: "Ah, I'm really sorry... but I don't think I can find out or estimate exactly when I was diagnosed with ADHD and Avoidant Personality Disorder. To be honest, it's not something I've kept track of over time, and my medical records might not have that information readily available either."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Angela. That can be challenging to track over time. Moving forward, have you had any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that might be relevant to your current health status?

User: "No, I don't have any previous hospitalizations or surgeries that might be relevant to my current health status. To confirm, I've never had any major medical procedures or hospital stays in the past."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that, Angela. That helps clarify your medical history a bit more. Now, could you tell me if you've ever had any head injuries or concussions?

User: "No, I've never had any head injuries or concussions."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information with me. Now, let's discuss your history of seizures. Have you ever experienced any seizures in the past?

User: "No, I've never had any seizures that I'm aware of."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information with me. Now, let's move on to another topic. Have you ever participated in any rehab programs or received substance counselling?

User: "I haven't been to rehab or formal substance counselling, but I have attended some wine addiction support groups... it was helpful in a way, just being around people who understand what you're going through."

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your experiences with support groups; that takes a lot of courage. Now, could you tell me if there are any other medical professionals you've seen besides those mentioned earlier?

User: "I've also seen my family doctor from time to time for check-ups and stuff... it's just routine appointments, nothing too serious."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on to discuss your family history regarding mental and neurological health. Is there any history of psychiatric conditions in other family members?

User: "No, there isn't any history of psychiatric conditions in my family as far as I know. My siblings and I have always been relatively healthy, and our parents never mentioned anything about mental health issues in our family."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to ask a bit more about your siblings. Could you tell me how many siblings you have, and if it's okay with you, their ages?

User: I have two older siblings, a brother named Tiago who's 32 years old, and a sister named Beatriz who's 29.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, could you tell me a bit more about your early life? Specifically, where were you born?

User: "I was born in South Ashleyburgh, Canada."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Since you were born in Canada, I assume you're a Canadian citizen?

User: Yes, that's correct.

Assistant: Thank you for confirming that. Now, let's discuss your birth further. Were there any complications during your birth?

User: "To my knowledge, there weren't any complications during my birth. At least, that's what my parents have always told me."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's talk about your early development. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I'm not really sure, but from what I remember and what my parents told me, I think I developed relatively normally as a child. I don't recall having any major issues with walking or talking at a young age, but I do know that I had some difficulties making friends due to my avoidant personality disorder."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to move on and talk a bit about your education. Were there any difficulties in elementary school?

User: "No, there weren't any significant difficulties in elementary school that I can recall. My parents and teachers have always told me that I was an extending student, which means I performed relatively well and met expectations."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Moving forward, what was your average mark in high school, and did you have a favorite topic or class during that time?

User: "I don't recall my exact average mark in high school, but I do know that my performance was considered 'extending', which means I met expectations. As for favorite topics or classes, I'm not really sure... I think I enjoyed learning about various subjects, but none that really stand out as a clear favorite. To be honest, I'm a bit uncertain about this, and it's making me feel a bit anxious."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, and I appreciate your honesty about feeling uncertain and anxious. That takes a lot of courage. Now, let's talk about further education after high school. Did you pursue any post-secondary education, such as college or university?

User: Yes, I pursued further education after high school and obtained a post-secondary certificate or diploma.

Assistant: That’s helpful to know, thank you. Now, could you tell me more about your post-secondary education? For example, where did you study and what type of certificate or diploma did you obtain?
   
   Note: I'm acknowledging the patient's response while gently probing for more specific information to gather a clearer understanding of their educational background.

User: "I'm not sure I can provide more details about my post-secondary education. I know I obtained a post-secondary certificate or diploma, but I don't recall specifics about where I studied or what type of certificate it was. I wish I could remember more, but my memory isn't great when it comes to that period in my life."

Assistant: Would you mind trying to think back a bit more about your post-secondary education? Sometimes, taking a moment to reflect can help jog one's memory. If not, we can certainly move on to other topics and come back to this later if needed.

User: "I'll try to think back... but honestly, I'm still having trouble remembering specifics about my post-secondary education. It's frustrating because I wish I could recall more, but it's just not coming to me right now."

Assistant: Thank you for trying to recall more information about your post-secondary education. I understand it can be frustrating when we can't remember specifics. Moving forward, let's talk about your employment history. Can you tell me a bit about any previous work experience you've had?

User: "I used to work as a part-time sales associate at a local clothing store, but I had to leave due to health issues."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Can you tell me more about your health issues that led you to leave your job?

User: "I have been dealing with avoidant personality disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, which made it really tough for me to interact with customers and manage my tasks effectively at the clothing store. It's hard for me to talk about this, but I'm trying to be open about my struggles."

Assistant: Thank you for being so honest with me; it helps a lot. Now, I'd like to ask about your personal relationships and support systems. Can you tell me a bit about any close friends or family members who are supportive of you?

User: "I'm really close to my son Lucas; he's always been a source of comfort for me. As for other family members, I have two older siblings, Tiago and Beatriz, who are both supportive in their own ways, even though we don't live close by."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like having a supportive family network is really helpful for you. If there's anything else you'd like to share about your personal history or any other topic, this would be a good opportunity to bring it up. What are some things you enjoy doing in your free time?

User: "I really enjoy doing things that help me relax and unwind. In my free time, you can find me reading fiction novels or taking long walks outside. I also try to practice yoga whenever I can, as it helps calm my mind and body. Listening to classical music, taking warm baths, and meditating are some other activities that bring me peace and comfort."

Assistant: If you're comfortable sharing, could you tell me a bit more about each of your siblings' basic info such as name, age, where they live, and occupation?
