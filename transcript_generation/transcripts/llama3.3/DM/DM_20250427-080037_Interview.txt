User: "Ah, yeah... I've struggled with substance abuse in the past. It's hard for me to talk about this, but I'll try. I'm not really sure how frequently I consume these substances nowadays... I mean, I've tried to cut back on some of them, but it's a bit of a challenge for me."

Assistant: Thank you for being open with me about your struggles, Jeremy. I understand it can be challenging to discuss. To help me better understand, could you try to provide more specific information about how often you use nicotine, marijuana, and alcohol? For example, do you use them daily, weekly, or only on special occasions?

Please respond with the patient's answer to this clarification question.

User: "It's... um... I don't really keep track of it, but I'd say I use nicotine maybe a few times a week? And marijuana... occasionally, like on weekends or special occasions. As for alcohol... I try not to drink too much, but sometimes I might have one or two drinks during social events."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jeremy. I appreciate your honesty about your substance use. Now, let's move on to discussing any current medications and dosages you're taking. Could you please tell me about any prescription or over-the-counter medications you're currently using?

Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions or diagnoses? If so, could you please provide details such as when you were diagnosed and what kind of care you've received for these conditions?

User: "I've been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder... I'm not really sure when exactly, but it's been something I've struggled with for a while now. As for care, I've been seeing Dr. Kim Chae-won and taking Venlafaxine as prescribed. To be honest, it's been helpful in managing my symptoms, but some days are still tougher than others."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jeremy. I'm glad to hear that your treatment has been somewhat helpful in managing your symptoms. Now, let's move on to discussing any previous hospitalizations or surgeries you've had. Have you ever been hospitalized or undergone surgery?

User: "Yes, I have been hospitalized before... actually, it happened three times. Two of those times were because of my social anxiety disorder getting really bad, and the other time was for a substance abuse treatment program."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Jeremy. Now, let's move on to discussing any history of head injuries or concussions you may have experienced. Have you ever had a head injury or concussion?

User: Yes, I have had head injuries before... actually, it happened twice. One was from a sports injury when I was in high school and the other one was from a minor car accident when I was 25.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your head injuries, Jeremy. Could you tell me more about what happened during those incidents? For example, were you knocked unconscious or did you experience any memory loss afterward?

User: "Well, for the first head injury, I think I was just dazed and confused after it happened. I don't remember being knocked unconscious, but I do recall feeling really disoriented and having a headache for a while afterward. As for the second head injury, I'm pretty sure I wasn't knocked out either, but I did have some trouble remembering what had happened right before the accident. I'm not entirely sure about the details of what happened after each incident, as it was a while ago and my memory might be fuzzy on some points."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your head injuries, Jeremy. That's helpful to know. I'd like to ask another question related to your medical history now. Have you ever experienced any seizures?

User: "Yes, I have experienced seizures before. I think it happened years ago... I'm not really sure of the exact timing or how many times it occurred."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information, Jeremy. If you don't mind me asking, could you try to elaborate more on when these seizures occurred and how many times you think it happened? Additionally, did you receive any medical attention or diagnosis related to the seizures?

User: "Uh, I think it happened when I was younger... maybe in high school or something? I'm not really sure how many times it occurred, but I remember being taken to the hospital at least once for it. Sorry, it's just really hard for me to remember exactly when and how many times... it's all kinda fuzzy in my head."

Assistant: I appreciate your effort in trying to remember those details. It can be challenging to recall everything from years ago. Thank you for sharing what you could about the seizures. Let’s move on to discussing family history if that's okay with you? Is there any history of psychiatric conditions or neurological disorders in your immediate or extended family?

User: "I've never really talked about it with my family members, but I don't think there's any history of psychiatric conditions or neurological disorders... at least, not that I'm aware of. My sister Karen being a nurse is probably the closest thing, but like I said, I don't think there's anything specific."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information, Jeremy. Since you mentioned your sister Karen being a nurse, I'd like to ask more about your siblings if that's okay? Could you tell me how many siblings you have and their names?

User: "I have one older sister, her name is Karen Mckay. She's actually a nurse."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your sister, Jeremy. Could you tell me a bit more about Karen? For example, where does she live and what kind of nursing does she do?

User: "I don't really know much about her work specifics, but she lives... um... I think she's still in the Philippines? Or maybe she moved to Canada too? I'm not really sure, we don't talk that often. I'm sorry, I don't have much information about her work or current location. We haven't been in close contact lately."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you could about Karen, Jeremy. I'd like to ask another question related to your personal history now if that's okay? Where were you born?

User: "I was born in Crystal Ville, Philippines."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know your birthplace, Jeremy. Are you a Canadian citizen?

User: "Yes."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know your birthplace and citizenship status, Jeremy. Now, I'd like to ask about any potential complications during your birth?

User: "I don't think so... I mean, I'm not aware of any complications during my birth."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. At a young age, did you walk, talk, and develop friendships like other kids?

User: "I think so... I mean, I didn't have any problems that I'm aware of."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that, Jeremy. Now, I'd like to discuss your educational background a bit more. Did you experience any difficulties in elementary school?

User: "I don't think so... I was actually on track during elementary school, but I'm not really sure if everything was perfect. I just know that my parents and teachers didn't mention any major issues back then."

Assistant: That’s helpful to know, thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to discuss your high school experience a bit more. Could you tell me about your average mark in high school and what was your favorite topic or class?

User: "Uh, I think my average mark in high school was... decent. Not great, but not terrible either. I'd say it was around... average? To be honest, I don't really remember the exact grades, but I do recall that my parents and teachers said I was doing okay. As for my favorite topic or class, I really enjoyed arts and music. We had a pretty cool graphics design program, which I guess helped me develop some skills that I use now as a freelance graphic designer."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to discuss your further education after high school. Did you pursue any further studies or training?

User: Yes, I pursued further studies after high school and obtained a post-secondary certificate or diploma.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that you pursued further studies after high school and obtained a post-secondary certificate or diploma. Could you share with me where you studied and what type of studies you completed?

User: "I'm not entirely sure about the exact name of the institution, but I think it was a local college or art school in British Columbia, Canada. Unfortunately, the details are a bit fuzzy. However, I do recall that I studied something related to graphic design, which helped me develop my skills and eventually become a freelance graphic designer."

Assistant: Thank you for trying to recall those details; I appreciate your honesty. If you don't mind, could you tell me a bit more about what made you choose graphic design as a field of study?

User: "To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what specifically drew me to graphic design, but I think it was because I really enjoyed playing around with graphics and designs during my free time in high school. It seemed like a natural fit for me, and I found it pretty enjoyable. Plus, it's something that allows me to be creative, which is important to me."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on what drew you to graphic design. I appreciate your honesty about not being entirely sure of all the specific factors involved. Let's move on to discuss another topic now, if that's okay with you. Could you tell me a bit about any previous work history?

User: "I've had some previous work experience. I used to work as a part-time barista for about two years, and then I also worked as a freelance graphic designer for around a year."

Assistant: That helps me understand your background in graphic design a bit better, thank you. Now, I'd like to discuss your previous work history further. You mentioned working as a part-time barista and as a freelance graphic designer. Could you tell me more about those companies where you worked, such as their names and the years of your employment?

User: "I'm not sure I remember the exact names of the companies where I worked as a barista. It was just a part-time job, and I didn't really think to keep track of that information. As for my freelance graphic design work, I mostly worked with private clients or small businesses, so there isn't really a specific company name to mention. I'm sorry I don't have more detailed information."

Assistant: Thank you for trying to recall those details; I appreciate your honesty. Now, let's move on to discuss another topic if that's okay with you. Have you ever been married or been in any long-term relationships?

User: "Yes, I was in a long-term relationship that lasted for about three years. Unfortunately, it ended due to personal differences."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate your openness about your previous relationship. Let's move on now, if you're ready. What kinds of things do you enjoy doing in your free time?

User: I really enjoy playing guitar, writing poetry, and taking photos in my free time. It helps me relax and express myself creatively. I also find solace in listening to calming music, meditating through guided apps, and taking short walks around the neighborhood."

Assistant: That's great that you've found activities that help you relax and express yourself creatively. Now, I'd like to ask, what do you do to relax on a stressful day?

User: "I usually relax by meditating through guided apps, listening to calming music, and taking short walks around my neighborhood."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to discuss something a bit different. Is there anything else you think the doctor needs to know about your situation or any other thoughts you have that might be helpful for us to consider as we move forward?

User: "Actually, now that I think about it... there is something else that comes to mind. It's not really related to my current situation, but I did have a few hospitalizations in the past for social anxiety disorder exacerbations and substance abuse treatment. Maybe that's relevant? And also, I've had some head injuries and concussions in the past, which might be worth noting. Oh, and I almost forgot - I do take turmeric/curcumin as a health supplement, not sure if that's important. There’s more, but I don’t think it’s important."
