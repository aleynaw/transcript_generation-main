User: "I'm not sure about the exact number of years my studio has been in operation. However, I did work as a freelance photographer for about 10 years before deciding to open my own studio. Let me think for a moment... I'd say my studio has been around for maybe 5-7 years now?"

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Would it be possible to narrow down the exact years of operation for your studio, or is the estimate of 5-7 years sufficient? Additionally, if yes, what is the name of your company?

Please let me know if this response meets your requirements!

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. I'd like to clarify a bit more about your substance use, if you're comfortable discussing it further. Could you tell me more specifically about how often you have an occasional drink socially? For example, is it once a week, once a month, or less frequently?
