Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: "I'm not really sure about the exact years I've been working there... I think it's been a few years now? Unfortunately, I don't recall the exact company name at the moment."

Assistant: I understand it can be hard to remember specifics. Would you mind elaborating a bit more on what you mean by 'a few years' and perhaps we could explore ways to jog your memory about the company name?

User: "Honestly, I'm not really sure how to estimate the exact number of years... it feels like I've been working in television production for around 2-3 years now? As for the company name, I'm really sorry but it's just not coming to me right now. It's frustrating because I know I should remember it. Maybe if you could give me some hints or ask me more questions about my work, it might help jog my memory?"

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. It's understandable that recalling specific details can be challenging at times. Given your role as a television production assistant, let's move on to discussing any potential sources of stress or discomfort in your work environment. Could you tell me about any disability assistance status or if there are any accommodations provided by your employer?

User: "Honestly, it can be pretty tough for me at work sometimes due to my mobility issues... I have flexibility and pain-related problems that affect my daily activities, including using a wheelchair for long distances. Unfortunately, I don't receive any disability assistance from my employer. It's something I wish they would provide more support with, but so far, it hasn't been the case."

User: "I apologize, but I don't recall mentioning a specialist for anxiety issues earlier. As for my current doctors, I only see Dr. Mr. Evan Cloonan regularly. Regarding allergies, I'm not aware of any specific medications or substances that I'm allergic to, but I do take several medications regularly, including Risperidone (Risperdal), Escitalopram (Lexapro), and Valproate (Depakote)."
