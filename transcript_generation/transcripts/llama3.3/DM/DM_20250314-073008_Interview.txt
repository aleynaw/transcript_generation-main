For example, were the reactions immediate or delayed? Did you ever seek medical attention for these occurrences?

Let's move forward after this clarification!

User: "I'm not entirely sure which specific plants caused the skin irritation, but it happened occasionally when I was handling certain flora during my work as a horticultural therapist. The reactions were usually immediate, and I would experience some redness and itching on my hands. It wasn't severe enough for me to seek medical attention, so I just made sure to wear gloves or wash my hands thoroughly after handling those plants. To be honest, it was a bit frustrating at times, but I learned to manage it by taking precautions."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Moving on, could you please tell me about any current medications you're taking and their dosages?

User: "I'm currently taking two medications. One is Fluoxetine, also known as Prozac, with a dosage of 40-80 mg per day. The other is Amphetamine/Dextroamphetamine, which I know by the brand name Adderall, and my dosage for that is 5-40 mg per day, taken in divided doses."
