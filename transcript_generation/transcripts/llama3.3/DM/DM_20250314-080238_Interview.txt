Assistant: Good day, I am Dr. Gordiy Farenukâ€™s Interview Assistant and I was asked to connect with you before your appointment on March 09 at the medical clinic. My goal is to gather some background information for the doctor.
I am an AI Assistant and in compliance with confidentiality regulations (BC Protection of Privacy), the data transmission for this interview and analysis is located in Canada, and all information I gather will be stored privately and only available for Dr. Gordiy Farenuk to review. Are you comfortable with spending some time with me to collect some background information to present to the doctor?

User: Yeah, I'm okay with that... I guess. It's just that talking about personal stuff can be a bit uncomfortable for me, but if it's going to help Dr. Farenuk understand my situation better, then I'll try to cooperate.

Assistant: Thank you for being open about your feelings, and I appreciate your willingness to cooperate. This will indeed help Dr. Farenuk better understand your situation. Let's start with some general information. Could you please tell me your full name?

User: My full name is Radha Tambeji.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. What name do you prefer being called?

User: Honestly, I prefer being called Radha. It's just what I'm used to, and it feels more natural when people call me by my first name.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Radha. I'd like to ask about some more personal details if that's okay with you. Could you please tell me your date of birth?

User: My date of birth is March 17, 2002.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing your date of birth with me, Radha. Now, could you please tell me about your sex?

User: I'm a female.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Radha. Now, I'd like to ask about your handedness - do you consider yourself left-handed, right-handed, or ambidextrous (able to use both hands equally well)?

User: I'm right-handed.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Radha. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your living situation. Could you please tell me what city or town you currently reside in?

User: I live in Lake Phillipberg.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Radha. Now, I'd like to ask about your marital status - are you single, in a relationship, married, or in a common-law relationship?

User: I'm single.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Radha. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any children or dependents?

User: "I'm not in a situation where I have dependents, so the answer is no."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know, Radha. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your work situation. Are you currently working?

User: "No, I'm not currently working. I'm actually a student right now."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Radha. Now, I'd like to ask about your disability assistance status - do you currently receive any disability benefits or support?

User: "No, I do not currently receive any disability benefits or support."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, I'd like to discuss your medical history. Could you tell me about your current doctors?

User: "I'm not entirely sure, but I think I've been seeing a doctor for my depression at the university health center... or was it through a referral? Hmm, sorry, I'm getting confused..."

Assistant: "Don't worry, Radha; it's okay to be unsure. Could you try to think of any details that might help you remember who your current doctor is? For example, do you recall a specific name or location?"

User: "Um, let me think for a moment... I'm pretty sure it was through the university health center, but I don't recall the specific doctor's name. I think it was a female doctor, and she had a kind face... I'm sorry, that's all I can remember right now. I'm really trying to recall the details, but it's just not coming to me right now. Maybe if you give me some time, I can try to think of more specifics?"

Assistant: Thank you for trying to remember, Radha. That's completely okay if you're unsure about some details right now. Could you expand a bit more on what you mean by "through the university health center or was it through a referral"? For example, do you remember any specific names, locations, or appointments that might help clarify who your current doctor is?

User: "Honestly, I'm still trying to piece together how I ended up seeing this doctor... I think it was because I went to the university health center for counseling services due to my depression, and they might have referred me to someone else or maybe even seen me themselves? I'm really sorry I don't remember more specifics - it's all a bit fuzzy. But I do know that I've been seeing this doctor at least a few times since starting university."

Assistant: Thank you for trying to remember more specifics about your current doctors. Given that you've been seeing a doctor through the university health center and you're unsure of some details, let's move on and come back if needed. Now, I'd like to ask about any allergies you might have? For example, are there any specific medications or environmental factors that cause allergic reactions for you?

User: "I don't recall having any allergic reactions or being diagnosed with any allergies."

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that, Radha. Now, could you tell me about any current medications you're taking, including dosage and frequency?

User: To be honest, I'm not really sure what my exact dosage is for my depression medication... it's something my doctor prescribed me, and I take it as directed. As for supplements, I take vitamin C daily, and sometimes dietary supplements when I remember. I also take melatonin before bed to help with sleep.

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you know about your medications. I'd like to ask a follow-up question to help clarify things: Would you mind asking your doctor or checking any prescription labels you might have to find out the specific name and dosage of your depression medication? This information could be really helpful in understanding your treatment plan better.

User: "Um, yeah... I can definitely try to ask my doctor or check any prescription labels I have at home to find out the specific name and dosage of my depression medication. It's just that, I don't usually pay close attention to those details, but I'll do my best to get you that information."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing what you know about your medications, Radha. Let's move on to another topic. Could you tell me a bit about any health conditions or diagnoses you've received in the past? For example, have you ever been hospitalized or undergone surgery for something?

User: "I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, but I haven't had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past. However, I did experience a concussion at age 19 due to a sports injury."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that, Radha. I'd like to ask a follow-up question about your concussion. Can you tell me more about what happened and how it affected you at the time? For example, did you experience any symptoms or have to undergo any treatment after the injury?

Please respond with the patient's answer.

User: "I remember it was during a game, and I got hit pretty hard. I don't recall the exact details, but I think I blacked out for a few seconds. After that, I experienced some headaches, dizziness, and sensitivity to light for a few weeks. It was really frustrating because I had to stop playing sports for a while, which is something I love doing. My doctor told me to rest and avoid any strenuous activities until my symptoms subsided."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing more about your concussion experience, Radha. I'd like to move on and ask another question. Have you ever experienced any seizures?

User: No, I haven't experienced any seizures.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know that. Now, could you tell me about any history of rehab or substance counseling? For example, have you ever attended a rehabilitation program or sought counseling for substance use?

User: "I've used substances in the past... I'd prefer not to discuss it further right now, if that's okay?"

Assistant: I understand, Radha. Thank you for letting me know that. Let's move on to another topic. Could you tell me a bit about any other medical professionals you've seen or worked with in the past? For example, therapists, specialists, or anyone else who has helped you manage your health conditions?

User: "I've seen a therapist to manage my depression... um, I don't really remember their name or specialty, but they helped me with medication and coping strategies. It was helpful at the time, but I'm not sure how much of an impact it had on my overall well-being."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing this information about your therapy experience. Moving on, can you describe any history of head injuries or concussions you might have experienced?

User: "I had a concussion when I was 19 years old. It happened during a sports injury, and I experienced some mild symptoms for a few weeks after that."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Could you elaborate on what kind of symptoms you experienced after your concussion, and did you seek any medical attention or treatment at that time?

User: "I experienced some dizziness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating after the concussion. My parents took me to see our family doctor, who advised us to monitor my symptoms and rest as much as possible. I think we also saw a specialist, maybe an orthopedic doctor or something... but I'm not really sure. My parents handled all of that at the time."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Let's move on to another topic. Have you ever had any seizures, either before or after the concussion?

User: No, I have never had any seizures.

Assistant: Thank you for letting me know. Now, let's move on to your personal history. Could you tell me a bit about your siblings?

User: I don't have any siblings.

Sometimes, I feel like I'm just going through the motions without any real purpose or motivation.
