Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me, Alder. It sounds like your career has been impacted significantly since your wife's passing. If I may ask, what is the name of the company or companies where you've done this freelance work?

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that information about your health supplements, Alder. Now, I'd like to ask about your use of nicotine, marijuana, or alcohol. How frequently do you use these substances?

Assistant: I understand that you don't recall attending rehab or substance counselling sessions. If it's okay with you, could you elaborate on what you mean by 'I don't recall'?

User: "Honestly, I'm saying 'I don't recall' because it's possible that I never actually went through rehab or substance counseling, and if I did, it's just not something that comes to mind when thinking about my past experiences."

Assistant: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's move on to discuss your family history a bit more. Have other medical professionals been involved in your care at any point?

User: "Yes, other medical professionals have been involved in my care at various points.
