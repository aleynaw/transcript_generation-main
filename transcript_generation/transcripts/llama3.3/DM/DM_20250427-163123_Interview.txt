User: "I'd be happy to share more about my concussions. The first one happened when I was 25 years old, during a sports injury. It was pretty rough at the time, but I managed to recover fully. Then, five years later, I got into a car accident and experienced another concussion. Thankfully, both times, I only had temporary issues with cognitive functions, and I didn't have any lasting effects. In terms of impact on my daily life or overall health, I'd say that these incidents made me more cautious about my physical activities and aware of the importance of taking care of myself."

User: "I don't think so... I'm pretty sure I've never had a seizure. At least, not that I can remember."
