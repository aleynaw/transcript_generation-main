    "    Function Overview\n",
    "    -----------------\n",
    "    - Randomly assigns ethnicity, sex, and name using `ethnicity_picker()` and `Faker()`.\n",
    "    - Selects an age category and determines the corresponding date of birth (`get_dob()`).\n",
    "    - Generates employment status, relationship status, and whether the patient has children based on age and marital status.\n",
    "    - Determines handedness, address, and occupation.\n",
    "    - Assigns a general practitioner or states \"None\" if no doctor is assigned.\n",
    "    - Randomly selects allergies, medical conditions, and medications (`generate_health_conditions()`).\n",
    "    - Determines substance use, past hospitalizations, head injuries, seizures, and family medical history.\n",
    "    - Generates educational background and employment history based on age and disability status.\n",
    "    - Assigns likelihood of past marriages/long-term relationships.\n",
    "    - Adds hobbies, relaxation methods, and personality-related details (typing style, conversational tone).\n",
    "    - Introduces optional \"Do Not Disclose\" scenarios for sensitive topics.\n",
    "    - Adds potential edge case scenarios to test LLM robustness.\n",
    "    - Returns the fully populated patient dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notes\n",
    "    -----\n",
    "    - Uses probability distributions and weights to ensure realism in assigned characteristics.\n",
    "    - Ensures generated attributes are internally consistent (e.g., age aligns with education/work history).\n",
    "    - Supports preset values in `preset_attributes` to maintain control over specific fields.\n",
