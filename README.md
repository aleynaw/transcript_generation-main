# Synthetic Patients and Interview Transcriptions Generation
Our pipeline is made up of three main steps: 1. Patient Creation (`./patient_creation`), 2. Transcript Generation (`./transcript_generation`), and 3. Analysis (`./analysis`).

To set up the environment, navigate to this directory in the terminal (Linux/Mac) or on Anaconda Prompt (Windows) and enter these commands:
```
conda env create -f transcript_gen.yml
```

To activate the environment, make sure to call this command first:
```
conda activate transcript_gen
```

To run the notebooks:
```
jupyter notebook
```
